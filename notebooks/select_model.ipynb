For another thing,\\nGraham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin-\\nishes the \\u201cmoral culpability\\u201d that attaches to the crime in\\nquestion, making those that do not intend to kill \\u201ccategori-\\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish-\\nment than are murderers.\\u201d 560 U.

Quite simply, if the juvenile\\neither kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \\u201ctwice\\ndiminished\\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither\\nkills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra-\\nham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would\\npermit life without parole for \\u201cjuveniles who commit the\\nworst types of murder,\\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,\\nC. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of\\none who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\\n  I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,\\nthe question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-\\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\nmurder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in\\nthe course of a felony to all participants who intended to\\ncommit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or\\nintended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\\nLaw \\u00a7\\u00a714.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been\\nbased on the idea of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d; the defendant\\u2019s\\nintent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill\\nrequired for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.\\nStreiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.\\n2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\\u2019s Criminal Law \\u00a7147 (15th ed.\\n1994).\\n   But in my opinion, this type of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d is\\nnot sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could\\nsubject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As\\nan initial matter, this Court has made clear that this\\nartificially constructed kind of intent does not count as\\nintent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not\\nrely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may\\nreceive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids\\nimposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in\\na robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and\\nsimply was \\u201cin the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting\\nto help the robbers escape.\\u201d Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.\\nTison, supra, at 157\\u2013158 (capital punishment permissi-\\nble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death\\nbecause he was \\u201cactively involved\\u201d in every aspect of the\\nkidnaping and his behavior showed \\u201ca reckless disregard\\nfor human life\\u201d). Given Graham, this holding applies to\\njuvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See\\nante, at 12\\u201313. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison\\nstandard of \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d may not be eligible for life\\nwithout parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The\\nonly juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to\\nlife without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses\\nwho \\u201ckill or intend to kill.\\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\\nat 18).\\n4                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\n   Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,\\nthere is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without\\nparole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to\\nkill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\\u2019s\\nintent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan-\\ngerous felony should understand the risk that the victim\\nof the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2\\nLaFave, supra, \\u00a714.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the\\nfull consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\\u2019s\\nconduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles\\nlack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8\\u20139. Justice Frank-\\nfurter cautioned, \\u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in\\nother cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit-\\nically transferred to a determination of a State\\u2019s duty to-\\nward children.\\u201d May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528, 536\\n(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of\\ntransferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to\\nsentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve\\nsuch \\u201cfallacious reasoning.\\u201d Ibid.\\n   This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres-\\nent in Kuntrell Jackson\\u2019s case. Jackson simply went\\nalong with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he\\nbecame aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially\\nstayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some-\\nthing like \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t playin\\u2019 \\u201d or \\u201c \\u2018I thought you all was\\nplayin,\\u2019 \\u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the\\nstore clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S.W.3d\\n757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of\\nfirst-degree murder under a statute that permitted them\\nto convict if, Jackson \\u201cattempted to commit or committed\\nan aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of-\\nfense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\\u2019s] death\\nunder circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the\\nvalue of human life.\\u201d Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. \\u00a75\\u201310\\u2013\\n101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,\\nJackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did\\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\nnot), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \\u201cex-\\ntreme indifference.\\u201d As long as one of the teenage accom-\\nplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to\\nthe value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of\\ncapital murder. Ibid.\\n   The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,\\nmight not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.\\nNorris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,\\nJ., dissenting) (\\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\\u2019s] intent to kill\\nwas severely lacking\\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amend-\\nment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the\\npossibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a\\nfinding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\\u2019s death,\\nthe question remains open whether the Eighth Amend-\\nment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a\\njuvenile in those circumstances as well.

SANCHEZ VALLE, ET AL.\",\n          \"The Court today disregards the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Civil Rules) in habeas corpus cases, chiefly because it believes that this departure will make no difference. See ante, at 209. Even if that were true, which it is not, I could not join this novel presumption against applying the Civil Rules.\\nThe Civil Rules \\\"govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature.\\\" Rule 1. This includes \\\"proceedings for . . . habeas corpus,\\\" Rule 81(a)(2), but only \\\"to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States [or] the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases\\\" (Habeas Rules), Civil Rule 81(a)(2); see also Habeas Rule 11. Thus, \\\"[t]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,\\\" Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 208 (2003), and do not contradict or undermine the provisions of the habeas corpus statute, Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 529-530 (2005).\\nAs the Court notes, the Civil Rules adopt the traditional forfeiture rule for unpleaded limitations defenses. See ante, at 207-208 (citing Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). The Court does not identify any \\\"inconsisten[cy]\\\" between this forfeiture rule and the statute, Rules, or historical practice of habeas proceedings\\u0097because there is none. Forfeiture of the limitations defense is demonstrably not inconsistent with traditional habeas practice, because, as the Court acknowledges, habeas practice included no statute of limitations until 1996. Ante, at 202, n. 1; see also infra, at 214-216. Forfeiture is perfectly consistent with Habeas Rule 5(b), which now provides that the State's \\\"answer . . . must state whether any *213 claim in the petition is barred by . . . statute of limitations.\\\" (Emphasis added.) And forfeiture is also consistent with (and indeed, arguably suggested by) Habeas Rule 4, because Rule 4 provides for sua sponte screening and dismissal of habeas petitions only prior to the filing of the State's responsive pleading.[1]\\nMost importantly, applying the forfeiture rule to the limitations period of 28 U.S. C. \\u00a7 2244(d) does not contradict or undermine any provision of the habeas statute. Quite the contrary, on its most natural reading, the statute calls for the forfeiture rule. AEDPA expressly enacted, without further qualification, \\\"[a] 1-year period of limitation\\\" for habeas applications by persons in custody pursuant to the judgments of state courts. \\u00a7 2244(d)(1) (emphasis added). We have repeatedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods such as that in \\u00a7 2244(d), without further elaboration, produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus subject to waiver and forfeiture. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982); see also Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 15 (2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 447 (2004). Absent some affirmative incompatibility with habeas practice, there is no reason why a habeas limitations period should be any different. By imposing an unqualified \\\"period of limitation\\\" against the background understanding that a defense of \\\"limitations\\\" must be raised in the answer, see Civil Rules 8(c), 12(b), the statute implies that the usual forfeiture rule is applicable.\\n*214 Instead of identifying an inconsistency between habeas corpus practice and the usual civil forfeiture rule, the Court urges that \\\"it would make scant sense to distinguish in this regard AEDPA's time bar from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners\\\" that may be raised sua sponte\\u0097ante, at 209\\u0097namely, exhaustion of state remedies, procedural default, nonretroactivity, and (prior to AEDPA) abuse of the writ. See Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 133 (1987) (exhaustion); Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 389 (1994) (nonretroactivity). But unlike AEDPA's statute of limitations, these defenses were all created by the habeas courts themselves, in the exercise of their traditional equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 717-718 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), because they were seen as necessary to protect the interests of comity and finality that federal collateral review of state criminal proceedings necessarily implicates. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 489-491 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 80-81 (1977) (procedural default); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 308 (1989) (nonretroactivity); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515 (1982) (exhaustion of state remedies). Unlike these other defenses, no time limitation\\u0097not even equitable laches\\u0097was imposed to vindicate comity and finality. AEDPA's 1-year limitations period is entirely a recent creature of statute. See ante, at 202, n. 1. If comity and finality did not compel any time limitation at all, it follows a fortiori that they do not compel making a legislatively created, forfeitable time limitation nonforfeitable.\\nIn fact, prior to the enactment of AEDPA, we affirmatively rejected the notion that habeas courts' traditionally broad discretionary powers would support their imposition of a time bar. Historically, \\\"there [wa]s no statute of limitations governing federal habeas, and the only laches recognized [wa]s that which affects the State's ability to defend against the claims raised on habeas\\\"\\u0097which was imposed by *215 Rule, and not until 1977. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993); see also United States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475 (1947); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 4268.2, pp. 497-498 (2d ed. 1988) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). We repeatedly asserted that the passage of time alone could not extinguish the habeas corpus rights of a person subject to unconstitutional incarceration. See Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 123 (1956); Chessman v. Teets, 354 U.S. 156, 164-165 (1957). For better or for worse, this doctrine was so well entrenched that the lower courts regularly entertained petitions filed after even extraordinary delays. See, e. g., Hawkins v. Bennett, 423 F.2d 948, 949 (CA8 1970) (40 years); Hamilton v. Watkins, 436 F.2d 1323, 1325 (CA5 1970) (at least 36 years); Hannon v. Maschner, 845 F.2d 1553, 1553-1555 (CA10 1988) (at least 24 years). And in 1977, when enactment of the former Habeas Rule 9(a) \\\"introduce[d] for the first time an element of laches into habeas corpus,\\\" 17A Wright & Miller \\u00a7 4268.2, at 498\\u0097by adopting the rule against \\\"`prejudicial delay'\\\" to which the Court refers, ante, at 202, n. 1\\u0097even that limited doctrine was treated as subject to the very same pleading requirements and forfeiture rule that the Court rejects today for the stricter limitations period of \\u00a7 2244(d). See Smith v. Secretary of New Mexico Dept. of Corrections, 50 F.3d 801, 821-822, n. 30 (CA10 1995); see also McDonnell v. Estelle, 666 F.2d 246, 249 (CA5 1982).\\nThere is, therefore, no support for the notion that the traditional equitable discretion that governed habeas proceedings permitted the dismissal of habeas petitions on the sole ground of untimeliness. Whether or not it should have, see Collins v. Byrd, 510 U.S. 1185, 1186-1187 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting), it did not. The Court's reliance on pre-existing equitable doctrines like procedural default and nonretroactivity is, therefore, utterly misplaced. Nothing in our tradition of refusing to dismiss habeas petitions as untimely *216 justifies the Court's decision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \\\"limitations period\\\" of \\u00a7 2244(d) by making it the subject of sua sponte dismissal.\\nIn what appears to be the chief ground of its decision, the Court also observes that \\\"the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting sua sponte, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the State's answer\\\" under Civil Rule 15(a). Ante, at 209. Although \\\"an amendment to the State's answer might have obviated this controversy,\\\" the Court concedes, \\\"we see no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.\\\" Ibid. But this consideration cuts in the opposite direction. If there truly were no \\\"dispositive difference\\\" between following and disregarding the rules that Congress has enacted, the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to disregard the Civil Rules.[2] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written. And, unlike the novel regime that the Court adopts today, which will apparently require the development of new rules from scratch, there already exists a well-developed body of law to govern the district courts' exercise of discretion under Rule *217 15(a). See 6 Wright & Miller \\u00a7\\u00a7 1484-1488 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2005). Ockham is offended by today's decision, even if no one else is.\\nBut, in fact, there are at least two notable differences between the Civil Rules and the sua sponte regime of such cases as Granberry and Caspari\\u0097both of which involve sufficiently significant departures from ordinary civil practice as to require clear authorization from the statute, the Rules, or historical habeas practice. First, the Granberry regime allows the forfeited procedural defense to be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the State or by the appellate court sua sponte. See 481 U.S., at 130, 133; Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 228-229 (1994). Ordinary civil practice does not allow a forfeited affirmative defense whose underlying facts were not developed below to be raised for the first time on appeal. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 764 (1975); Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1287 (CA7 1977). The ability to raise even constitutional errors in criminal trials for the first time on appeal is narrowly circumscribed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993). Comity and finality justified this departure from ordinary practice for historically rooted equitable defenses such as exhaustion. See Granberry, supra, at 134. But limitations was not such a defense.\\nAlso, Granberry and the like raise the possibility that the courts can impose a procedural defense over the State's affirmative decision to waive that defense. The Court takes care to point out that this is not such a case, ante, at 210-211, but it invites such cases in the future. After all, the principal justification for allowing such defenses to be raised sua sponte is that they \\\"`implicat[e] values beyond the concerns of the parties,'\\\" including \\\"`judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources'\\\" and \\\"the expeditious handling of habeas proceedings.\\\" Ante, at 205, 208 (quoting Acosta v. Artuz, 221 F.3d 117, 123 (CA2 2000)). There are *218 many reasons why the State may wish to disregard the statute of limitations, including the simple belief that it would be unfair to impose the limitations defense on a particular defendant. On the Court's reasoning, a district court would not abuse its discretion in overriding the State's conscious waiver of the defense in order to protect such \\\"`values beyond the concerns of the parties,'\\\" ante, at 205.[3] Under the Civil Rules, by contrast, amending a party's pleading over his objection would constitute a clear abuse of the trial court's discretion.\\nIn sum, applying the ordinary rule of forfeiture to the AEDPA statute of limitations creates no inconsistency with the Habeas Rules. On the contrary, it is the Court's unwarranted *219 expansion of the timeliness rule enacted by Congress that is inconsistent with the statute, the Habeas Rules, the Civil Rules, and traditional practice. I would hold that the ordinary forfeiture rule, as codified in the Civil Rules, applies to the limitations period of \\u00a7 2244(d). I respectfully dissent.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 2006,\n        \"max\": 2016,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2012,\n          2016,\n          2006\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Breyer\",\n          \"Ginsburg\",\n          \"Scalia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"dissenting\",\n          \"concurring\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I join the Court\\u2019s opinion in full.

Given \\u2019s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills nor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \\u201ctwice diminished\\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra- ham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would permit life without parole for \\u201cjuveniles who commit the worst types of murder,\\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of one who did not himself kill or intend to kill. I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases, the question of intent is a complicated one. The felony- Cite as: 567 U. S. (2012) 3 BREYER, J., concurring murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in the course of a felony to all participants who intended to commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or intended to kill. See 2 W. Substantive Criminal Law and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been based on the idea of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d; the defendant\\u2019s intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill required for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C. Streiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed. 2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\\u2019s Criminal Law (15th ed. 1994). But in my opinion, this type of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d is not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as intent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may receive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and simply was \\u201cin the car by the side of the road waiting to help the robbers escape.\\u201d Cf. at 157\\u2013158 (capital punishment permissi- ble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death because he was \\u201cactively involved\\u201d in every aspect of the kidnaping and his behavior showed \\u201ca reckless disregard for human life\\u201d). Given this holding applies to juvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See ante, at 12\\u201313. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the standard of \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d may not be eligible for life without parole. Rather, dictates a clear rule: The only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses who \\u201ckill or intend to kill.\\u201d 560 U. S., at (slip op., at 18). 4 MILLER v. ALABAMA BREYER, J., concurring Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults, there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to kill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\\u2019s intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan- gerous felony should understand the risk that the victim of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2 Yet the ability to consider the full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\\u2019s conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles lack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8\\u20139. Justice Frank- furter cautioned, \\u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit- ically transferred to a determination of a State\\u2019s duty to- ward children.\\u201d (1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve such \\u201cfallacious reasoning.\\u201d This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres- ent in Kuntrell Jackson\\u2019s case. Jackson simply went along with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he became aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some- thing like \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t playin\\u2019 \\u201d or \\u201c \\u2018I thought you all was playin,\\u2019 \\u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the store clerk. 194 S.W.3d 757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them to convict if, Jackson \\u201cattempted to commit or committed an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of- fense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\\u2019s] death under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\\u201d See \\u201310\\u2013 101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty, Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did Cite as: 567 U. S. (2012) 5 BREYER, J., concurring not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \\u201cex- treme indifference.\\u201d As long as one of the teenage accom- plices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of capital murder. The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk, might not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v. Norris, S. W. 3d (Danielson, J., dissenting) (\\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\\u2019s] intent to kill was severely lacking\\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amend- ment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the possibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\\u2019s death, the question remains open whether the Eighth Amend- ment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a juvenile in those circumstances as well.

The matter warrants attention in a future case in which a defendant faces successive prosecutions by parts of the whole USA. Cite as: 579 U. S. (2016) 1 Opinion of THOMAS, J. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 15\\u2013108 COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, PETITIONER v. LUIS M. SANCHEZ VALLE, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PUERTO RICO [June 9, 2016] JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. The Court today concludes that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States are not separate sover- eigns because the Federal Government is the ultimate source of Puerto Rico\\u2019s authority to prosecute crimes. Ante, at 16. I agree with that holding, which hews to the Court\\u2019s precedents concerning the Double Jeopardy Clause and U. S. Territories. But I continue to have concerns about our precedents regarding Indian law, see United (opinion concurring in judgment), and I cannot join the portions of the opinion concerning the application of the Double Jeop- ardy Clause to successive prosecutions involving Indian tribes. Aside from this caveat, I join the Court\\u2019s opinion. Cite as: 579 U. S.
