It can assuredly do that, by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The question in this case, however, is whether the complex structures and *647provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act, Act, or ACA) go beyond those powers. We conclude that they do.\\n\\nThis case is in one respect difficult: It presents two questions of first impression. The first of those is whether failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect on commerce, and hence might be said to come under this Court\\u2019s \\u201caffecting commerce\\u201d criterion of Commerce Clause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this Court extended the Clause that far. The second question is whether the congressional power to tax and spend, U. S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of a State\\u2019s continued receipt of all funds under a massive state-administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal program, but we have never found a law enacted under the spending power to be coercive. Those questions are difficult.\\n\\nThe case is easy and straightforward, however, in another respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the text of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon federal power\\u2014upon what it can prescribe with respect to private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the sovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax and spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to compel the States to function as administrators of federal programs.\\n\\nThat clear principle carries the day here. The striking case of Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), which held that the economic activity of growing wheat, even for one\\u2019s *648own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently that it could be regulated, always has been regarded as the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence. To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow wheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity at all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be federally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal power to virtually all human activity.\\n\\nAs for the constitutional power to tax and spend for the general welfare: The Court has long since expanded that beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were within the Federal Government\\u2019s enumerated powers, see United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 65-66 (1936). Thus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted to subjects not mentioned among Congress\\u2019 enumerated powers, and only marginally related to commerce: the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The principal practical obstacle that prevents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to assume all the general-welfare responsibilities traditionally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of managing a Federal Government large enough to administer such a system. That obstacle can be overcome by granting funds to the States, allowing them to administer the program. That is fair and constitutional enough when the States freely agree to have their powers employed and their employees enlisted in the federal scheme. But it is a blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the States have no choice.\\n\\nThe Act before us here exceeds federal power both in mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying non-consenting States all Medicaid funding. These parts of the Act are central to its design and operation, and all the Act\\u2019s other provisions would not have been enacted without *649them. In our view it must follow that the entire statute is inoperative.\\n\\nI\\n\\nThe Individual Mandate\\n\\nArticle I, \\u00a7 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \\u201cregulate Commerce ... among the several States.\\u201d The Individual Mandate in the Act commands that every \\u201capplicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.\\u201d 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 5000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision \\u201cregulates\\u201d anything, it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage. One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by payment of a penalty. But that failure\\u2014that abstention from commerce\\u2014is not \\u201cCommerce.\\u201d To be sure, purchasing insurance is \\u201cCommerce\\u201d; but one does not regulate commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.\\n\\nIn Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate commerce is the poviier \\u201cto prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.\\u201d That understanding is consistent with the original meaning of \\u201cregulate\\u201d at the time of the Constitution\\u2019s ratification, when \\u201cto regulate\\u201d meant \\u201c[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,\\u201d 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); \\u201c[t]o adjust by rule or method,\\u201d 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); \\u201c[t]o adjust, to direct according to rule,\\u201d 2 J. Ash, New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775); \\u201cto put in order, set to rights, govern or keep in order,\\u201d T. Dyche & W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (16th ed. 1777).1 It can mean to direct the *650manner of something but not to direct that something come into being. There is no instance in which this Court or Congress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used \\u201cregulate\\u201d in that peculiar fashion. If the word bore that meaning, Congress\\u2019 authority \\u201c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 14, would have made superfluous the later provision for authority \\u201c[t]o raise and support Armies,\\u201d id., \\u00a7 8, cl. 12, and \\u201c[t]o provide and maintain a Navy,\\u201d id., \\u00a7 8, cl. 13.\\n\\nWe do not doubt that the buying and selling of health insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to federal regulation. But when Congress provides that (nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it goes beyond \\u201cadjust[ing] by rule or method,\\u201d Johnson, supra, or \\u201cdirecting] according to rule,\\u201d Ash, supra; it directs the creation of commerce.\\n\\nIn response, the Government offers two theories as to why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitutional. Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.\\n\\nA\\n\\nFirst, the Government submits that \\u00a7 5000A is \\u201cintegral to the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s insurance reforms\\u201d and \\u201cnecessary to make effective the Act\\u2019s core reforms.\\u201d Brief for Petitioners in No. 11-398 (Minimum Coverage Provision) 24 (hereinafter Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief). Congress included a \\u201cfinding\\u201d to similar effect in the Act itself. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(H) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\\n\\nAs discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act contains numerous health insurance reforms, but most notable for present purposes are the \\u201cguaranteed issue\\u201d and \\u201ccommunity rating\\u201d provisions, \\u00a7\\u00a7 300gg to 300gg-4. The former provides that, with a few exceptions, \\u201ceach health insurance *651issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a State must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies for such coverage.\\u201d \\u00a7 300gg-1(a). That is, an insurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other things, any pre-existing medical condition that the applicant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover that condition. See \\u00a7 300gg-3.\\n\\nUnder ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would respond by charging high premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The Act seeks to prevent this through the community-rating provision. Simply put, the community-rating provision requires insurers to calculate an individual\\u2019s insurance premium based on only four factors: (i) whether the individual\\u2019s plan covers just the individual or his family also, (ii) the \\u201crating area\\u201d in which the individual lives, (iii) the individual\\u2019s age, and (iv) whether the individual uses tobacco. \\u00a7 300gg(a)(1)(A). Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and possibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to factor the individual\\u2019s health characteristics into the price of his insurance premium. This creates a new incentive for young and healthy individuals without pre-existing conditions. The insurance premiums for those in this group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will subsidize insurance for others in the pool. Many of them may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an economically sound decision\\u2014especially since the guaranteed-issue provision will enable them to purchase it at the same cost in later years and even if they have developed a pre-existing condition. But without the contribution of above-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the community-rating provision will not enable insurers to take on high-risk individuals without a massive increase in premiums.\\n\\nThe Government presents the Individual Mandate as a unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme governing many parties with countervailing incentives that must be *652carefully balanced. Congress has imposed an extensive set of regulations on the health insurance industry, and compliance with those regulations will likely cost the industry a great deal. If the industry does not respond by increasing premiums, it is not likely to survive. And if the industry does increase premiums, then there is a serious risk that its products\\u2014insurance plans\\u2014will become economically undesirable for many and prohibitively expensive for the rest.\\n\\nThis is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health insurance industry. Government regulation typically imposes costs on the regulated industry\\u2014especially regulation that prohibits economic behavior in which most market participants are already engaging, such as \\u201cpiecing out\\u201d the market by selling the product to different classes of people at different prices (in the present context, providing much lower insurance rates to young and healthy buyers). And many industries so regulated face the reality that, without an artificial increase in demand, they cannot continue on. When Congress is regulating these industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to enact \\u201c \\u2018all appropriate legislation\\u2019 \\u201d to \\u201c\\u2018protec[t]\\u2019\\u201d and \\u201c\\u2018advanc[e]\\u2019\\u201d commerce, NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1937) (quoting The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564 (1871)). Thus, Congress might protect the imperiled industry by prohibiting low-cost competition, or by according it preferential tax treatment, or even by granting it a direct subsidy.\\n\\nHere, however, Congress has impressed into service third parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not customers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesirable consequences of the regulation. Congress\\u2019 desire to force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated by the fact that they are further removed from the market than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions, because they are less likely to need extensive care in the near future. If Congress can reach out and command even those furthest removed from an interstate market to participate in the mar*653ket, then the Commerce Clause becomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton\\u2019s words, \\u201cthe hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane.\\u201d The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\\n\\nAt the outer edge of the commerce power, this Court has insisted on careful scrutiny of regulations that do not act directly on an interstate market or its participants. In New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the disposal of radioactive waste produced in several different industries, order the States to take title to that waste. Id., at 174-177. In Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the distribution of firearms in the interstate market, compel state law enforcement officials to perform background checks. Id., at 933-935. In United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), we held that Congress could not, as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor market through the protection of schools, ban the possession of a firearm within a school zone. Id., at 559-563. And in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), we held that Congress could not, in an effort to ensure the full participation of women in the interstate economy, subject private individuals and companies to suit for gender-motivated violent torts. Id., at 609-619. The lesson of these cases is that the Commerce Clause, even when supplemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, is not carte blanche for doing whatever will help achieve the ends Congress seeks by the regulation of commerce. And the last two of these cases show that the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty of the States but also when it violates the background principle of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.\\n\\nThe case upon which the Government principally relies to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary and *654Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005). That case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain the interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultivation and possession of that drug. Id., at 15-22. Raich is no precedent for what Congress has done here. That case\\u2019s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 317 U. S. 111), and of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into a broad new field. The mandating of economic activity does, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the economy, that mandating is not \\u201cconsistent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).\\n\\nMoreover, Raich is far different from the Individual Mandate in another respect. The Court\\u2019s opinion in Raich pointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions were the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition of interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced. 545 U. S., at 22. See also Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914) (Necessary and Proper Clause allows regulations of intrastate transactions if necessary to the regulation of an interstate market). Intrastate marijuana could no more be distinguished from interstate marijuana than, for example, endangered-species trophies obtained before the species was federally protected can be distinguished from trophies obtained afterwards\\u2014which made it necessary and proper to prohibit the sale of all such trophies, see Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979).\\n\\nWith the present statute, by contrast, there are many ways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate by which the regulatory scheme\\u2019s goals of reducing insurance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers could be achieved. For instance, those who did not purchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when they do enter the health insurance system. Or they could be denied *655a full income tax credit given to those who do purchase the insurance.\\n\\nThe Government was invited, at oral argument, to suggest what federal controls over private conduct (other than those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or other constitutional controls) could not be justified as necessary and proper for the carrying out of a general regulatory scheme. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-30, 43-45 (Mar. 27, 2012). It was unable to name any. As we said at the outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain, the proposition that the Federal Government cannot do everything is a fundamental precept. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 564 (\\u201c[I]f we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate\\u201d)- Section 5000A is defeated by that proposition.\\n\\nB\\n\\nThe Government\\u2019s second theory in support of the Individual Mandate is that \\u00a75000A is valid because it is actually a \\u201cregulation of] activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,... i. e.,... activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. \\u201d Id., at 558-559. See also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra. This argument takes a few different forms, but the basic idea is that \\u00a7 5000A regulates \\u201cthe way in which individuals finance their participation in the health care market.\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 33 (emphasis added). That is, the provision directs the manner in which individuals purchase health care services and related goods (directing that they be purchased through insurance) and is therefore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.\\n\\nThe primary problem with this argument is that \\u00a7 5000A does not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most, or even any, of the health care services or goods that the mandated insurance covers. Indeed, the main objection many *656have to the Mandate is that they have no intention of purchasing most or even any of such goods or services and thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases. The Government responds that the health care market involves \\u201cessentially universal participation,\\u201d id., at 35. The principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in the only relevant sense, not true. It is true enough that everyone consumes \\u201chealth care,\\u201d if the term is taken to include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin. But the health care \\u201cmarket\\u201d that is the object of the Individual Mandate not only includes but principally consists of goods and services that the young people primarily affected by the Mandate do not purchase. They are quite simply not participants in that market, and cannot be made so (and thereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of defining participants to include all those who will, later in their lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services covered by the mandated insurance.2 Such a definition of market participants is unprecedented, and were it to be a premise for the exercise of national power, it would have no principled limits.\\n\\nIn a variation on this attempted exercise of federal power, the Government points out that Congress in this Act has purported to regulate \\u201ceconomic and financial decision[s] to forego health insurance coverage and [to] attempt to self-insure,\\u201d 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(A), since those decisions have *657\\u201ca substantial and deleterious effect on interstate commerce,\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 34. But as the discussion above makes clear, the decision to forgo participation in an interstate market is not itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all) within Congress\\u2019 power to regulate. It is true that, at the end of the day, it is inevitable that each American will affect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by choice. But if every person comes within the Commerce Clause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason that he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a limited Government power is at an end.\\n\\nWickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most expansive assertion of the commerce power in our history. A close second is Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971), which upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local activity of loan sharking. Both of those cases, however, involved commercial activity. To go beyond that, and to say that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make loans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can be federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtually everything. All of us consume food, and when we do so the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality must be and even how much we must pay. But the mere fact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later, participants in the \\u201cmarket\\u201d for food, does not empower the Government to say when and what we will buy. That is essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the purchase of health care. It exceeds federal power.\\n\\nC\\n\\nA few respectful responses to Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s dissent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dissent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the test contains. It is true enough that Congress needs only a \\u201c \\u2018rational basis\\u2019 for concluding that the regulated activity substantially af*658fects interstate commerce,\\u201d ante, at 602 (emphasis added). But it must be activity affecting commerce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to engage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our test\\u2019s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution\\u2019s requirement that it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything. Ultimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is really no difference between action and inaction, ante, at 612-613, a proposition that has never recommended itself, neither to the law nor to common sense. To say, for example, that the inaction here consists of activity in \\u201cthe self-insurance market,\\u201d ante, at 613, seems to us wordplay. By parity of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called participation in the non-private-car-transportation market. Commerce becomes everything.\\n\\nThe dissent claims that we \\u201cfai[l] to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.\\u201d Ante, at 621. But we have done so. It threatens that order because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroying the Constitution\\u2019s division of governmental powers. Thus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity of the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional relation between the individual and the National Government. The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper Clause has been held to include \\u201cthe power to enact criminal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to create a national bank,\\u201d ibid. Is not the power to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser? No, not if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests upon a theory that everything is within federal control simply because it exists.\\n\\n*659The dissent\\u2019s exposition of the wonderful things the Federal Government has achieved through exercise of its assigned powers, such as \\u201cthe provision of old-age and survivors\\u2019 benefits\\u201d in the Social Security Act, ante, at 589, is quite beside the point. The issue here is whether the Federal Government can impose the Individual Mandate through the Commerce Clause. And the relevant history is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers in the past, but that it has never before used the Commerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3 The dissent treats the Constitution as though it is an enumeration of those problems that the Federal Government can address\\u2014among which, it finds, is \\u201cthe Nation\\u2019s course in the economic and social welfare realm,\\u201d ibid., and more specifically \\u201cthe problem of the uninsured,\\u201d ante, at 595. The Constitution is not that. It enumerates not federally soluble problems, but federally available powers. The Federal Government can address *660whatever problems it wants but can bring to their solution only those powers that the Constitution confers, among which is the power to regulate commerce. None of our cases say anything else. Article I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-problem power.\\n\\nThe dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to compel entry into the health insurance market would include the power to compel entry into the new-car or broccoli markets. The latter purchasers, it says, \\u201cwill be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment,\\u201d whereas those refusing to purchase health insurance will ultimately get treated anyway, at others\\u2019 expense. Ante, at 608. \\u201c[T]he unique attributes of the health-care market.. . give rise to a significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other markets.\\u201d Ante, at 614. And \\u201ca vegetable-purchase mandate\\u201d (or a car-purchase mandate) is not \\u201clikely to have a substantial effect on the health-care costs\\u201d borne by other Americans. Ante, at 615. Those differences make a very good argument by the dissent\\u2019s own lights, since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare problem that is (in the dissent\\u2019s view) included among the unenumerated \\u201cproblems\\u201d that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve. But those differences do not show that the failure to enter the health insurance market, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is an activity that Congress can \\u201cregulate.\\u201d (Of course one day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us\\u2014in which case, under the theory of Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s dissent, moving against those inactivities will also come within the Federal Government\\u2019s unenumerated problem-solving powers.)\\n\\n*661I\\u2014<\\n\\nThe Taxing Power\\n\\nAs far as \\u00a7 5000A is concerned, we would stop there. Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its Commerce Clause authority,4 and \\u00a75000A is therefore invalid. The Government contends, however, as expressed in the caption to Part II of its brief, that \\u201cthe minimum coverage PROVISION IS INDEPENDENTLY AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS\\u2019S taxing power\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 52. The phrase \\u201cindependently authorized\\u201d suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen in the United States Reports: a penalty for constitutional purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes. In all our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty or else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was imposed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.5 The two are mutually exclusive. Thus, what the Government\\u2019s caption should have read was \\u201calternatively, the minimum coverage provision is not a mandate-with-penalty but A tax.\\u201d It is important to bear this in mind in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of *662those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision as a tax, but whether it did so.\\n\\nIn answering that question we must, if \\u201cfairly possible,\\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932), construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty, since that would render it constitutional rather than unconstitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat). But we cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. \\u201c \\u2018 \\u201c[A]lthough this Court will often strain to construe legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting the purpose of a statute ...\\u201d or judicially rewriting it.\\u2019\\u201d Commodity Futures Trading Comm\\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 841 (1986) (quoting Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 515 (1964), in turn quoting Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961)). In this ease, there is simply no way, \\u201cwithout doing violence to the fair meaning of the words used,\\u201d Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden, 112 U. S. 261, 269 (1884), to escape what Congress enacted: a mandate that individuals maintain minimum essential coverage, enforced by a penalty.\\n\\nOur cases establish a clear line between a tax and a penalty: \\u201c \\u2018(A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government; a penalty ... is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.\\u2019\\u201d United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 224 (1996) (quoting United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568, 572 (1931)). In a few cases, this Court has held that a \\u201ctax\\u201d imposed upon private conduct was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty. But we have never held\\u2014 never\\u2014that a penalty imposed for violation of the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax. We have never held that any exaction imposed for violation of the law is an exercise of Congress\\u2019 taxing power\\u2014even when the statute calls it a tax, much less when (as here) the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty. When an Act \\u201cadoptfe] the criteria of wrong*663doing\\u201d and then imposes a monetary penalty as the \\u201cprincipal consequence on those who transgress its standard,\\u201d it creates a regulatory penalty, not a tax. Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38 (1922).\\n\\nSo the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. The minimum coverage provision is found in 26 U. S. C. \\u00a75000A, entitled \\u201cRequirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.\\u201d (Emphasis added.) It commands that every \\u201capplicable individual shall... ensure that the individual... is covered under minimum essential coverage.\\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). And the immediately following provision states that, \\u201c[i]f... an applicable individual... fails to meet the requirement of subsection (a)... there is hereby imposed ... a penalty.\\u201d \\u00a75000A(b) (emphasis added). And several of Congress\\u2019 legislative \\u201cfindings\\u201d with regard to \\u00a75000A confirm that it sets forth a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere taxing power. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(A) (\\u201cThe requirement regulates activity . . . \\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(C) (\\u201cThe requirement . . . will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market . . . \\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(D) (\\u201cThe requirement achieves near-universal coverage\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(H) (\\u201cThe requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(3) (\\u201c[T]he Supreme Court of the United'States ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation\\u201d).\\n\\nThe Government and those who support its view on the tax point rely on New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, to justify reading \\u201cshall\\u201d to mean \\u201cmay.\\u201d The \\u201cshall\\u201d in that case was contained in an introductory provision\\u2014a recital that provided for no legal consequences\\u2014which said that \\u201c[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing ... for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste.\\u201d 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A). The Court did not hold that \\u201cshall\\u201d could *664be construed to mean \\u201cmay,\\u201d but rather that this preliminary provision could not impose upon the operative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not contain: \\u201cWe ... decline petitioners\\u2019 invitation to construe \\u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to the States independent of the remainder of the Act.\\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 170. Our opinion then proceeded to \\u201cconsider each [of the three operative provisions] in turn.\\u201d Ibid. Here the mandate\\u2014the \\u201cshall\\u201d\\u2014is contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital, but in the dispositive operative provision itself. New York provides no support for reading it to be permissive.\\n\\nQuite separately, the fact that Congress (in its own words) \\u201cimposed ... a penalty,\\u201d 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 5000A(b)(1), for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render that failure unlawful. It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: \\u201c[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for a lawful act.\\u201d Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R. Co., 24 How. 247, 252 (1861). Or in the words of Chancellor Kent: \\u201cIf a statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, the penalty implies a prohibition, and the thing is unlawful, though there be no prohibitory words in the statute.\\u201d 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 436 (1826).\\n\\nWe never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a penalty. To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a tax a statutory exaction (imposed for something other than a violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that does not entail the significant constitutional consequences of a penalty\\u2014such as \\u201clicense\\u201d (License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462 (1867)) or \\u201csurcharge\\u201d (New York v. United States, supra.). But we have never\\u2014never\\u2014treated as a tax an exaction which faces up *665to the critical difference between a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a \\u201cpenalty.\\u201d Eighteen times in \\u00a75000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction,in \\u00a7 5000A(b) a \\u201cpenalty.\\u201d\\n\\nThat \\u00a7 5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact that some are exempt from the tax who are not exempt from the mandate\\u2014a distinction that would make no sense if the mandate were not a mandate. Section 5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of \\u201capplicable individual\\u201d subject to the minimum coverage requirement: those with religious objections or who participate in a \\u201chealth care sharing ministry,\\u201d \\u00a7 5000A(d)(2); those who are \\u201cnot lawfully present\\u201d in the United States, \\u00a7 5000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcerated, \\u00a7 5000A(d)(4). Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: those who cannot afford coverage, \\u00a7 5000A(e)(l); who earn too little income to require filing a tax return, \\u00a7 5000A(e)(2); who are members of an Indian tribe, \\u00a7 5000A(e)(3); who experience only short gaps in coverage, \\u00a7 5000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \\u201chave suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain coverage,\\u201d \\u00a7 5000A(e)(5). If \\u00a75000A were a tax, these two classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.\\n\\nIn the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General assures us that \\u201cneither the Treasury Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services interprets Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation,\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 61, and that \\u201c[i]f [those subject to the Act] pay the tax penalty, they\\u2019re in compliance with the law,\\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (Mar. 26, 2012). These self-serving litigating *666positions are entitled to no weight. What counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely clear. It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances contradict the Government\\u2019s position in related litigation. Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. \\u00a738.2-3430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, \\u201cNo resident of [the] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the Department of Social Services . . . .\\u201d In opposing Virginia\\u2019s assertion of standing to challenge \\u00a75000A based on this statute, the Government said that \\u201cif the minimum coverage provision is unconstitutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the minimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is void under the Supremacy Clause.\\u201d Brief for Appellant in No. 11-1057 etc. (CA4), p. 29. But it would be void under the Supremacy Clause only if it was contradicted by a federal \\u201crequire[ment] to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage.\\u201d\\n\\nAgainst the mountain of evidence that the minimum coverage requirement is what the statute calls it\\u2014a requirement\\u2014and that the penalty for its violation is what the statute calls it\\u2014a penalty\\u2014the Government brings forward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary. It notes that \\u201c[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted individual. . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to the income tax itself,\\u201d and that \\u201c[t]he [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal Revenue Code.\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 53. The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if IRS penalty-collection were unheard of or rare. It is not. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 527(j) (IRS-collectible penalty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures); \\u00a7 5761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of tobacco products labeled for export); \\u00a79707 (IRS-*667collectible penalty for failure to make required health insurance premium payments on behalf of mining employees). In Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a \\u201ctax\\u201d was in fact a penalty. \\u201c[I]f the concept of penalty means anything,\\u201d we said, \\u201cit means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.\\u201d Id., at 224. See also Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty is assessed and collected by the IRS, \\u00a75000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of Veterans Affairs), see \\u00a7\\u00a75000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v), (f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for defining its substantive scope\\u2014 a feature that would be quite extraordinary for taxes.\\n\\nThe Government points out that \\u201c[t]he amount of the penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor and [a] ca[p],\\u201d and that individuals who earn so little money that they \\u201care not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty\\u201d (though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the mandate). Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 12, 53. But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an utterly familiar practice. See, e. g., 33 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1319(d) (2006 ed.) (\\u201cIn determining the amount of a civil penalty the court shall consider . . . the economic impact of the penalty on the violator\\u201d); see also 6 U. S. C. \\u00a7 488e(c) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); 7 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 7734(b)(2), 8313(b)(2) (2006 ed.); 12 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1701q-1(d)(3), 1723i(c)(3), 1735f-14(c)(3), 1735f-15(d)(3), 4585(c)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); 15 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a745(m)(1)(C), 77h-1(g)(3), 78u-2(d), 80a-9(d)(4), 80b-3(i)(4), 1681s(a)(2)(B), 1717a(b)(3), 1825(b)(1), 2615(a)(2)(B), 5408(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV); 33 U. S. C. \\u00a7 2716a(a) (2006 ed.).\\n\\nThe last of the feeble arguments in favor of petitioners that we will address is the contention that what this statute *668repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it contains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a requirement suggests a penalty\\u2014though one can imagine a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of such a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for absolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a \\u201csevere penalty.\\u201d Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618 (1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter requirement.\\n\\nAnd the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core, rather than where a tax would be found\\u2014in Title IX, containing the Act\\u2019s \\u201cRevenue Provisions.\\u201d In sum, \\u201cthe terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,\\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a regulatory penalty, not a tax.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have never been popular, see, e. g., Stamp Act of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. See Art. I, \\u00a7 7, cl. 1. That is to say, they must originate in the legislative body most accountable to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election, which is never more than two years off. The Federalist No. 58 \\u201cdefended] the decision to give the origination power to the House on the ground that the Chamber that is more accountable to the people should have the primary role in raising revenue.\\u201d United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990). We have no doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was *669doing when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See Affordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \\u00a7 501 (2009); America\\u2019s Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \\u00a7 1301. Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.\\n\\nFinally, we must observe that rewriting \\u00a7 5000A as a tax in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States according to their population. Art. I, \\u00a7 9, cl. 4. Perhaps it is not (we have no need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters. The Government\\u2019s opening brief did not even address the question\\u2014 perhaps because, until today, no federal court has accepted the implausible argument that \\u00a7 5000A is an exercise of the tax power. And once respondents raised the issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its reply brief to the issue. Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Reply Brief 25. At oral argument, the most prolonged statement about the issue was just over 50 words. Tr. of Oral Arg. 79 (Mar. 27, 2012). One would expect this Court to demand more than fly-by-night briefing and argument before deciding a difficult constitutional question of first impression.\\n\\nh-1 HH\\n\\nThe Anti-Injunction Act\\n\\nThere is another point related to the Individual Mandate that we must discuss\\u2014a point that logically should have been discussed first: whether jurisdiction over the challenges to the minimum-coverage provision is precluded by the Anti-*670Injunction Act, which provides that \\u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,\\u201d 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 7421(a) (2006 ed.).\\n\\nWe have left the question to this point because it seemed to us that the dispositive question whether the minimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately addressed in the significant constitutional context of whether it is an exercise of Congress\\u2019 taxing power. Having found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding that these suits do not have \\u201cthe purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\\u201d6\\n\\nThe Government and those who support its position on this point make the remarkable argument that \\u00a7 5000A is not *671a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, see Brief for Petitioners in No. 11-398 (Anti-Injunction Act), but is a tax for constitutional purposes, see Petitioners\\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief 52-62. The rhetorical device that tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is the same device employed in arguing that for constitutional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax: confusing the question of what Congress did with the question of what Congress could have done. What qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is entirely within the control of Congress. Compare Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16, 20 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act barred suit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax Law), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36-41 (holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Congress\\u2019 taxing power). Congress could have defined \\u201ctax\\u201d for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude some exactions that in fact are \\u201ctaxes.\\u201d It might have prescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the taxing power \\u201cshall not be regarded as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\\u201d But there is no such prescription here. What the Government would have us believe in these cases is that the very same textual indications that show this is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act show that it is a tax under the Constitution. That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the sophists.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nThe Medicaid Expansion\\n\\nWe now consider respondents\\u2019 second challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act\\u2019s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress\\u2019 power to attach conditions to federal grants to the States.\\n\\nThe ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go along: termi*672nation of all the State\\u2019s Medicaid funding. For the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is equal to more than one-fifth of the State\\u2019s expenditures.7 A State forced out of the program would not only lose this huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to increase its own health care expenditures substantially, requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other programs or a large increase in state taxes. And these new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by the State\\u2019s citizens to fund the Medicaid program in other States.\\n\\nThe States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA\\u2019s Medicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical reasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at all. As proof of this, they point to the goal and the structure of the ACA. The goal of the Act is to provide near-universal medical coverage, 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(D), and without 100% state participation in the Medicaid program, attainment of this goal would be thwarted. Even if States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program, while declining to participate in the Expansion, there would be a gaping hole in coverage. And if a substantial number of States were entirely expelled from the program, the number of persons without coverage would be even higher.\\n\\nIn light of the ACA\\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage, petitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything less than 100% state participation was a realistic possibility, Congress would have provided a backup scheme. But no such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than 900 pages of the Act. This shows, they maintain, that Congress was certain that the ACA\\u2019s Medicaid offer was one that no State could refuse.\\n\\nIn response to this argument, the Government contends that any congressional assumption about uniform state par*673ticipation was based on the simple fact that the offer of federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is such a generous gift that no State would want to turn it down.\\n\\nTo evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of the Federal Government\\u2019s power to spend money and to attach conditions to money granted to the States.\\n\\nA\\n\\nNo one has ever doubted that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to spend money, but for many years the scope of this power was unsettled. The Constitution grants Congress the power to collect taxes \\u201cto . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States,\\u201d Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 1, and from \\u201cthe foundation of the Nation sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to the true interpretation of the phrase\\u201d \\u201cthe general welfare.\\u201d Butler, 297 U. S., at 65. Madison, it has been said, thought that the phrase \\u201camounted to no more than a reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section,\\u201d while Hamilton \\u201cmaintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated [and] is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them.\\u201d Ibid.\\n\\nThe Court resolved this dispute in Butler. Writing for the Court, Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian view would make Article I\\u2019s grant of the spending power a \\u201cmere tautology.\\u201d Ibid. To avoid that, he adopted Hamilton\\u2019s approach and found that \\u201cthe power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.\\u201d Id., at 66. Instead, he wrote, the spending power\\u2019s \\u201cconfines are set in the clause which confers it, and not in those of \\u00a78 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress.\\u201d Ibid.; see also Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 586-587 (1937); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640 (1937).\\n\\n*674The power to make any expenditure that furthers \\u201cthe general welfare\\u201d is obviously very broad, and shortly after Butler was decided the Court gave Congress wide leeway to decide whether an expenditure qualifies. See Helvering, 301 U. S., at 640-641. \\u201cThe discretion belongs to Congress,\\u201d the Court wrote, \\u201cunless the choice is clearly wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of judgment.\\u201d Id., at 640. Since that time, the Court has never held that a federal expenditure was not for \\u201cthe general welfare.\\u201d\\n\\nB\\n\\nOne way in which Congress may spend to promote the general welfare is by making grants to the States. Monetary grants, so-called grants-in-aid, became more frequent during the 1930\\u215b, G. Stephens & N. Wikstrom, American Intergovernmental Relations\\u2014A Fragmented Federal Polity 83 (2007), and by 1950 they had reached $20 billion8 or 11.6% of state and local government expenditures from their own sources.9 By 1970 this number had grown to $123.7 billion10 or 29.1% of state and local government expenditures from their own sources.11 As of 2010, federal outlays to state and local governments came to over $608 billion or 37.5% of state and local government expenditures.12\\n\\n*675When Congress makes grants to the States, it customarily attaches conditions, and this Court has long held that the Constitution generally permits Congress to do this. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206 (1987); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 474 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C. J.); Steward Machine, supra, at 593.\\n\\nC\\n\\nThis practice of attaching conditions to federal funds greatly increases federal power, \\u201c[Objectives not thought to be within Article I\\u2019s enumerated legislative fields, may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds.\\u201d Dole, supra, at 207 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Post-secondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (by attaching conditions to federal funds; Congress may induce the States to \\u201ctak[e] certain actions that Congress could not require them to take\\u201d).\\n\\nThis formidable power, if not checked in any way, would present a grave threat to the system of federalism created by our Constitution. If Congress\\u2019 \\u201cSpending Clause power to pursue objectives outside of Article I\\u2019s enumerated legislative fields,\\u201d Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 654 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted), is \\u201climited only by Congress\\u2019 notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives \\u2018power to the Congress to tear down the barriers, to invade the states\\u2019 jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed,\\u2019 \\u201d Dole, supra, at 217 (O\\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (quoting Butler, supra, at 78). \\u201c[T]he Spending Clause power, if wielded without concern for the federal bal-*676anee, has the potential to obliterate distinctions between national and local spheres of interest and power by permitting the Federal Government to set policy in the most sensitive areas of traditional state concern, areas which otherwise would lie outside its reach.\\u201d Davis, supra, at 654-655 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\\n\\nRecognizing this potential for abuse, our cases have long held that the power to attach conditions to grants to the States has limits. See, e. g., Dole, 483 U. S., at 207-208; id., at 207 (spending power is \\u201csubject to several general restrictions articulated in our cases\\u201d). For one thing, any such conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at least knows what it is getting into. See Pennhurst, supra, at 17. Conditions must also be related \\u201cto the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,\\u201d Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 461 (1978) (plurality opinion), and the conditional grant of federal funds may not \\u201cinduce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,\\u201d Dole, supra, at 210; see Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 269-270 (1985). Finally, while Congress may seek to induce States to accept conditional grants, Congress may not cross the \\u201cpoint at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement.\\u201d Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 590. Accord, College Savings Bank, supra, at 687; Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 285 (1991) (White, J., dissenting); Dole, supra, at 211.\\n\\nWhen federal legislation gives the States a real choice whether to accept or decline a federal aid package, the federal-state relationship is in the nature of a contractual relationship. See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002); Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17. And just as a contract is voidable if coerced, \\u201c[t]he legitimacy of Congress\\u2019 power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of *677the \\u2018contract.\\u2019\\u201d Ibid, (emphasis added). If a federal spending program coerces participation the States have not \\u201cexercise[d] their choice\\u201d\\u2014let alone made an \\u201cinformed choice.\\u201d Id., at 17, 25.\\n\\nCoercing States to accept conditions risks the destruction of the \\u201cunique role of the States in our system.\\u201d Davis, supra, at 685 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). \\u201c[T]he Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress\\u2019 instructions.\\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 162. Congress may not \\u201csimply commandeer the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\\u201d Id., at 161 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Congress effectively engages in this impermissible compulsion when state participation in a federal spending program is coerced, so that the States\\u2019 choice whether to enact or administer a federal regulatory program is rendered illusory.\\n\\nWhere all Congress has done is to \\u201cencouragfe] state regulation rather than compe[l] it, state governments remain responsive to the local electorate\\u2019s preferences; state officials remain accountable to the people. [But] where the Federal Government compels States to regulate, the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished.\\u201d Id., at 168.\\n\\nAmici who support the Government argue that forcing state employees to implement a federal program is more respectful of federalism than using federal workers to implement that program. See, e. g., Brief for Service Employees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11-398, pp. 25-26. They note that Congress, instead of expanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely federal program to provide coverage for the same group of people. By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative federal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for more state control. Ibid.\\n\\n*678This argument reflects a view of federalism that our cases have rejected\\u2014and with good reason. When Congress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the lines of political accountability. If the Federal Government makes a controversial decision while acting on its own, \\u201cit is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular.\\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 168. But when the Federal Government compels the States to take unpopular actions, \\u201cit may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.\\u201d Id., at 169; see Printz, 521 U. S., at 930. For this reason, federal officeholders may view this \\u201cdepartur[e] from the federal structure to be in their personal interests ... as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual decision.\\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 182-183. And even state officials may favor such a \\u201cdeparture from the constitutional plan,\\u201d since uncertainty concerning responsibility may also permit them to escape accountability. Id., at 182. If a program is popular, state officials may claim credit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were merely responding to a federal directive.\\n\\nOnce it is recognized that spending-power legislation cannot coerce state participation, two questions remain: (1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is the ACA\\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now turn to those questions.\\n\\nD\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe answer to the first of these questions\\u2014the meaning of coercion in the present context\\u2014is straightforward. As we have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States\\u2019 choice to accept or decline the offered package. *679Therefore, if States really have no choice other than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power. And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear, theoretical voluntariness is not enough.\\n\\nIn South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the State\\u2019s federal highway funds on the State\\u2019s adoption of a minimum drinking age of 21 years. South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we disagreed, reasoning that \\u201cCongress ha[d] directed only that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds.\\u201d 483 U. S., at 211. Because \\u201call South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5% of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified highway grant programs,\\u201d we found that \\u201cCongress ha[d] offered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose.\\u201d Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with the federal condition \\u201cremain[ed] the prerogative of the States not merely in theory but in fact,\\u201d and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress\\u2019 power. Id., at 211-212 (emphasis added).\\n\\nThe question whether a law enacted under the spending power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but where Congress has plainly \\u201ccrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,\\u201d New York, supra, at 175, a federal program that coopts the States\\u2019 political processes must be declared unconstitutional. \\u201c[T]he federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene.\\u201d Lopez, 514 U. S., at 578 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe Federal Government\\u2019s argument in this case at best pays lipservice to the anticoercion principle. The Federal *680Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are \\u201cfree, as a matter of law, to turn down\\u201d federal funds. Brief for Respondents in No. 11-400, p. 17 (emphasis added); see also id., at 25. According to the Federal Government, neither the amount of the offered federal funds nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining whether there is impermissible coercion. Id., at 41-46.\\n\\nThis argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and to substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient, withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents to support subsidies to participating States.13\\n\\nAcceptance of the Federal Government\\u2019s interpretation of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dictate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the state or local level. Suppose, for example, that Congress enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the State\\u2019s entire annual expenditures for primary and secondary education. Suppose also that this fon ding came with conditions governing such things as school curriculum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of school districts, the length and *681hours of the school day, the school calendar, a dress code for students, and rules for student discipline. As a matter of law, a State could turn down that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support this expensive new program, but they would also be forced to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes. And if the State gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivisions would surrender their traditional authority in the field of education. Asked at oral argument whether such a law would be allowed under the spending power, the Solicitor General responded that it would. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 11-400, pp. 44-45 (Mar. 28, 2012).\\n\\nE\\n\\nWhether federal spending legislation crosses the line from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine, and courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear. In this case, however, there can be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion. If the anti-coercion rule does not apply in this case, then there is no such rule.\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong support to the petitioner States\\u2019 argument that refusing to accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realistic option. Before the ACA\\u2019s enactment, Medicaid funded medical care for pregnant women, families with dependents, children, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1396a(a)(10) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). The ACA greatly expands the program\\u2019s reach, making new funds available to States that agree to extend coverage to all individuals who are under age 65 and have incomes below 133% of the federal poverty line. See \\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. *682IV). Any State that refuses to expand its Medicaid programs in this way is threatened with a severe sanction: the loss of all its federal Medicaid funds. See \\u00a7 1396c (2006 ed.).\\n\\nMedicaid has long been the largest federal program of grants to the States. See Brief for Respondents in No. 11-400, at 37. In 2010, the Federal Government directed more than $552 billion in federal funds to the States. See Nat. Assn, of State Budget Officers, 2010 State Expenditure Report: Examining Fiscal 2009-2011 State Spending, p. 7 (2011) (NASBO Report). Of this, more than $233 billion went to pre-expansion Medicaid. See id., at 47.14 This amount equals nearly 22% of all state expenditures combined. See id., at 7.\\n\\nThe States devote a larger percentage of their budgets to Medicaid than to any other item. Id., at 5. Federal funds account for anywhere from 50% to 83% of each State\\u2019s total Medicaid expenditures, see \\u00a71396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); most States receive more than $1 billion in federal Medicaid funding; and a quarter receive more than $5 billion, NASBO Report 47. These federal dollars total nearly two thirds\\u2014 64.6%\\u2014of all Medicaid expenditures nationwide.15 Id., at 46.\\n\\n*683The Court of Appeals concluded that the States failed to establish coercion in this case in part because the \\u201cstates have the power to tax and raise revenue, and therefore can create and fund programs of their own if they do not like Congress\\u2019s terms.\\u201d 648 F. 3d 1235, 1268 (CA11 2011); see Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11-400, p. 21 (\\u201cStates may always choose to decrease expenditures on other programs or to raise revenues\\u201d). But the sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to state expenditures means that a State would be very hard pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by cutting other spending or raising additional revenue. Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expenditures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third of Arizona\\u2019s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See NASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion Medicaid. This means that the State would have to allocate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose. See ibid.\\n\\nThe States are far less reliant on federal funding for any other program. After Medicaid, the next biggest federal funding item is aid to support elementary and secondary education, which amounts to 12.8% of total federal outlays to the States, see id., at 7, 16, and equals only 6.6% of all state expenditures combined. See ibid. In Arizona, for example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are equal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education funds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures. See ibid. And even in States with less than average federal Medicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of federal education *684funding as a percentage of state expenditures. Id., at 7, 16, 47.\\n\\nA State forced out of the Medicaid program would face burdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid funding. For example, a nonparticipating State might be found to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is premised on the expectation that States will participate in Medicaid. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 602(a)(3) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be \\u201celigible for medical assistance under the State[\\u2019s Medicaid] plan\\u201d). And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medicaid program would not relieve a State\\u2019s hospitals of their obligation under federal law to provide care for patients who are unable to pay for medical services. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, \\u00a7 1395dd, requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out its mandate. Many of these patients are now covered by Medicaid. If providers could not look to the Medicaid program to pay for this care, they would find it exceedingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were given substantial state support. See, e. g., Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11-400, p. 11.\\n\\nFor these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the States\\u2014go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding\\u2014is quite unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending-power case. In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount that the States would have lost if every single State had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking age was approximately $614.7 million\\u2014or about 0.19% of all state expenditures combined. See Nat. Assn, of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987-1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989), http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-report/archives. South Dakota stood to lose, at most, fund*685ing that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state expenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of all federal outlays to the States, or approximately $233 billion. See N\\u00c1SBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual state expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7 million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures combined, is aptly characterized as \\u201crelatively mild encouragement,\\u201d but threatening to withhold $233 billion, equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a different matter.\\n\\n2\\n\\nWhat the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal and structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\\n\\nThe stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care coverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that every person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions are designed to make qualifying insurance available and affordable for persons with medical conditions that may require expensive care. Other ACA provisions seek to make such policies more affordable for people of modest means. Finally, for low-income individuals who are simply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded Medicaid, transforming it from a program covering only members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a program that provides at least the requisite minimum level of coverage for the poor. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), 1396u-7(a), (b)(5), 18022(a). This design was intended to provide at least a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans, but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on participation by every single State. If any State\\u2014not to *686mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit\\u2014chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping hole in the ACA\\u2019s coverage.\\n\\nIt is true that some persons who are eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private insurance, either through their employers or by obtaining subsidized insurance through an exchange. See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 36B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respondents in No. 11-400, at 12. But the new federal subsidies are not available to those whose income is below the federal poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other than Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage and comply with the Mandate. The Government counters that these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 11-400, p. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents in No. 11-400, at 49-50, but that argument misses the point: Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have coverage and the ACA\\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage will be severely frustrated.\\n\\nIf Congress had thought that States might actually refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Congress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that the most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously eligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold. But nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be found. By contrast, because Congress thought that some States might decline federal funding for the operation of a \\u201chealth benefit exchange,\\u201d Congress provided a backup scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in and operate an exchange in that State. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18041(c)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Likewise, knowing that States would not necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens lawfully present in the United States\\u2014because Medicaid does not require States to provide such coverage\\u2014Congress extended the availability of the new federal insurance subsidies to all aliens. See 26 *687U. S. C. \\u00a7 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals who are \\u201cnot eligible for the medicaid program ... by reason of [their] alien status\\u201d)- Congress did not make these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed that they would be covered by Medicaid. If Congress had contemplated that some of these citizens would be left without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State\\u2019s withdrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies provided for low-income aliens.\\n\\nThese features of the ACA convey an unmistakable message: Congress never dreamed that any State would refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid. Congress well understood that refusal was not a practical option.\\n\\nThe Federal Government does not dispute the inference that Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it argues that this assumption was based on the fact that ACA\\u2019s offer was an \\u201cexceedingly generous\\u201d gift. Brief for Respondents in No. 11-400, at 50. As the Federal Government sees things, Congress is like the generous benefactor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to 50 randomly selected individuals. Just as this benefactor might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap up his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would gratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go with the expansion of Medicaid.\\n\\nThis characterization of the ACA\\u2019s offer raises obvious questions. If that offer is \\u201cexceedingly generous,\\u201d as the Federal Government maintains, why have more than half the States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer is coercive? And why did Congress find it necessary to threaten that any State refusing to accept this \\u201cexceedingly generous\\u201d gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds? Congress could have made just the new funding provided under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of the Medicaid *688Expansion. Congress took such an approach in some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the program so that only new funding was conditioned on new eligibility extensions. See, e. g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.\\n\\nCongress\\u2019 decision to do otherwise here reflects its understanding that the ACA offer is not an \\u201cexceedingly generous\\u201d gift that no State in its right mind would decline. Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very substantial costs on participating States. It is true that the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs associated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying 100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals between 2014 and 2016. 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1396d(y). But that is just part of the picture. Participating States will be forced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after 2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the costs associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state spending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by 2020 as a consequence. Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, CBO\\u2019s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 24 (Mar. 30, 2011); see also R. Bovbjerg, B. Ormond, & V. Chen, Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, State Budgets Under Federal Health Reform: The Extent and Causes of Variations in Estimated Impacts 4, n. 27 (Feb. 2011) (estimating new state spending at $43.2 billion through 2019). After 2019, state spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the Congressional Budget Office estimates new state spending at $60 billion through 2021. Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24. And these costs may increase in the future because of the very real possibility that the Federal Government will change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds it will cover. This would leave the States to bear an increasingly large percentage of the bill. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 11-400, pp. 74-76 (Mar. 28, 2012). Finally, after 2015, the States will have to pick up the tab *689for 50% of all administrative costs associated with implementing the new program, see \\u00a7\\u00a7 1396b(a)(2)-(5), (7) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), costs that could approach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020, see Dept, of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30.\\n\\nIn sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress\\u2019 spending power and cannot be implemented.\\n\\nF\\n\\nSeven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid Expansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional. See Parts IV-A to IV-E, supra; Part IV-A, ante, at 575-585 (opinion of Roberts, C. J., joined by Breyer and Kagan, JJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional, the question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However, the Government proposes\\u2014in two cursory sentences at the very end of its brief\\u2014preserving the Expansion. Under its proposal, States would receive the additional Medicaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would keep their preexisting Medicaid funds if they do not expand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government\\u2019s suggestion.\\n\\nThe reality that States were given no real choice but to expand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on States\\u2019 having no choice, because its Mandate requires low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Furthermore, a State\\u2019s withdrawal might subject everyone in the State to much higher insurance premiums. That is because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the cost to the insurance *690industry imposed by the ACA\\u2019s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in more detail in the sever-ability section below. To make the Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA\\u2019s structure and design \\u201c \\u2018would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is no part of our duty.\\u2019\\u201d Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).\\n\\nWorse, the Government\\u2019s proposed remedy introduces a new dynamic: States must choose between expanding Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If this divisive dynamic between and among States can be introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional choice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not doubt that States are capable of making decisions when put in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this Court to put them there.\\n\\nThe Government cites a severability clause codified with Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating that if \\u201cany provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\\u201d 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1303. But that clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7 should not be invalidated if \\u00a7 1396c, the authorization for the cutoff of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It does not tell us that \\u00a7 1396c can be judicially revised, to say what it does not say. Such a judicial power would not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps the doctrine of amendatory invalidation\\u2014similar to the amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation. The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but would leave it up to the Court what the \\u201cvalidated\\u201d legislation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting the cutoff of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it might just as well have permitted, say, the cutoff of funds that repre*691sent no more than x percent of the State\\u2019s budget. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises \\u00a7 1396c to read as the Court would desire.\\n\\nWe should not accept the Government\\u2019s invitation to attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the Government\\u2019s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and authority do not rest with this Court.\\n\\nV\\n\\nSeverability\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve \\u201cnear-universal\\u201d health insurance coverage. \\u00a718091(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The two pillars of the Act are the Individual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid. In our view, both these central provisions of the Act\\u2014the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\\u2014are invalid. It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well. The following section explains the severability principles that require this conclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV-F, supra, which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act alters its dynamics.\\n\\nA\\n\\nWhen an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the validity of the remaining provisions. The Court\\u2019s authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been well established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Ju*692diciary Act of 1789. And while the Court has sometimes applied \\u201cat least a modest presumption in favor of... sever-ability,\\u201d C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 144 (2011), it has not always done so, see, e. g., Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S. 172, 190-195 (1999).\\n\\nAn automatic or too cursory severance of statutory provisions risks \\u201crewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.\\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935). The Judiciary, if it orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court\\u2019s decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of policies, risks, and duties that Congress did not enact. That can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was considered at the outset.\\n\\nThe Court has applied a two-part guide as the framework for severability analysis. The test has been deemed \\u201cwell established.\\u201d Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987). First, if the Court holds a statutory provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Congress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be invalidated. See id., at 685. In Alaska Airlines, the Court clarified that this first inquiry requires more than asking whether \\u201cthe balance of the legislation is incapable of functioning independently.\\u201d Id., at 684. Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way, that alone does not save the statute. The question is whether the provisions will work as Congress intended. The \\u201crelevant inquiry in evaluating sever-ability is whether the statute will fimction in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress.\\u201d Id., at 685 (emphasis in original). See also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 509 (2010) (the Act \\u201cremains fully operative as a law with these tenure *693restrictions excised\\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 227 (2005) (\\u201c[T]wo provisions ... must be invalidated in order to allow the statute to operate in a manner consistent with congressional intent\\u201d); Mille Lacs, supra, at 194 (\\u201c[E]mbodying as it did one coherent policy, [the entire order] is inseverable\\u201d).\\n\\nSecond, even if the remaining provisions can operate as Congress designed them to operate, the Court must determine if Congress would have enacted them standing alone and without the unconstitutional portion. If Congress would not, those provisions, too, must be invalidated. See Alaska Airlines, supra, at 685 (\\u201c[T]he unconstitutional provision must be severed unless the statute created in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have enacted\\u201d); see also Free Enterprise Fund, supra, at 509 (\\u201c[N]othing in the statute\\u2019s text or historical context makes it \\u2018evident\\u2019 that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will\\u201d); Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330 (2006) (\\u201cWould the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all\\u201d); Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\\u201cWould Congress still have passed \\u00a7 10(a) had it known that the remaining provisions were invalid\\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\\n\\nThe two inquiries\\u2014whether the remaining provisions will operate as Congress designed them, and whether Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions standing alone\\u2014often are interrelated. In the ordinary course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate according to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted them (the second inquiry). This close interaction may explain why the Court has not always been precise in distinguishing between the *694two. There are, however, occasions in which the severability standard\\u2019s first inquiry (statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining provisions to stand alone).\\n\\nB\\n\\nThe Act was passed to enable affordable, \\u201cnear-universal\\u201d health insurance coverage. 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(D). The resulting, complex statute consists of mandates and other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others. Under the severability test set out above, it must be determined if those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are themselves invalid.\\n\\nCongress did not intend to establish the goal of near-universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences. See, e. g., ACA \\u00a7 1563, 124 Stat. 270 (\\u201c[T]his Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\\u201d). And it did not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set of regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to obtain health insurance. See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 5000A(a). Insurance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients\\u2019 pre-existing conditions and to comply with a host of other regulations. And the companies must pay new taxes. See \\u00a7 4980I (high-cost insurance plans); 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 300gg(a)(1), 300gg-4(b) (community rating); \\u00a7\\u00a7 300gg-1, 300gg-3, 300gg-4(a) (guaranteed issue); \\u00a7300gg-11 (elimination of coverage limits); \\u00a7 300gg-14(a) (dependent children up to age 26); ACA \\u00a7\\u00a7 9010, 10905, 124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) \\u00a7 1401, 124 Stat. 1059 (excise tax). States are expected to expand Medicaid eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces *695called exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (Medicaid Expansion), 18031 (exchanges). Some persons who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on health insurance exchanges. See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 36B (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal subsidies). The Federal Government\\u2019s increased spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in federal payments to hospitals. See, e. g., \\u00a7 1395ww(r) (Medicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (\\u201cRevenue Offset Provisions\\u201d). Employers with at least 50 employees must either provide employees with adequate health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance through an exchange. See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 4980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\\n\\nIn short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers\\u2014while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions of those costs with new benefits to each group. For example, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance-regulations and taxes, including \\u201cguaranteed issue\\u201d and \\u201ccommunity rating\\u201d requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured\\u2019s pre-existing conditions; but the insurers benefit from the *696new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate to buy the insurers\\u2019 product and from the new low-income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies\\u2019 Medicaid-funded managed care programs. In summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending. So, the Act\\u2019s major provisions are interdependent.\\n\\nThe Act then refers to these interdependencies as \\u201cshared responsibility.\\u201d See ACA Subtitle F, Part I, 124 Stat. 242 (\\u201cShared Responsibility\\u201d); ACA \\u00a7 1501, ibid. (same); ACA \\u00a7 1513, id., at 253 (same); ACA \\u00a7 4980H, ibid. (same). In at least six places, the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working \\u201ctogether with the other provisions of this Act.\\u201d 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(C) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to \\u201cadd millions of new consumers to the health insurance market\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(E) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to \\u201csignificantly reduce\\u201d the economic cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured); \\u00a7 18091(2)(F) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to \\u201clower health insurance premiums\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(G) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to \\u201cimprove financial security for families\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(I) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to minimize \\u201cadverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(J) (working \\u201ctogether\\u201d to \\u201csignificantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums\\u201d). The Act calls the Individual Mandate \\u201can essential part\\u201d of federal regulation of health insurance and warns that \\u201cthe absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.\\u201d \\u00a7 18091(2)(H).\\n\\nC\\n\\nOne preliminary point should be noted before applying severability principles to the Act. To be sure, an argument can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the *697parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonseverable. The response to this argument is that our cases do not support it. See, e. g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co. of La., 278 U. S. 235, 242-244 (1929). (holding nonseverable statutory provisions that did not burden the parties). It would be particularly destructive of sound government to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of legislation like the ACA. It would take years, perhaps decades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated separately\\u2014and for some of them (those simply expending federal funds) no one may have separate standing. The Federal Government, the States, and private parties ought to know at once whether the entire legislation fails.\\n\\nThe opinion now explains in Part V-C-1, infra, why the Act\\u2019s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion. It proceeds from the insurance regulations and taxes (C-1-a), to the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions (C-1-b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C-1-c), and the employer-responsibility assessment (C-1-d). Part V-C-2, infra, explains why the Act\\u2019s minor provisions also are not severable.\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe Act\\u2019s Major Provisions\\n\\nMajor provisions of the Affordable Care Act\\u2014i. e., the insurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spending reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies, and the employer-responsibility assessment\\u2014cannot remain once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are invalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability of the other major provisions to operate as Congress intended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected burdens on patients, the *698health care community, and the federal budget. That consequence would be in absolute conflict with the ACA\\u2019s design of \\u201cshared responsibility,\\u201d and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did not intend.\\n\\na\\n\\nInsurance Regulations and Taxes\\n\\nWithout the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion, the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s insurance regulations and insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and their customers that this Court cannot measure. Those risks would undermine Congress\\u2019 scheme of \\u201cshared responsibility.\\u201d See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 4980I (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (high-cost insurance plans); 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 300gg(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 300gg-4(b) (community rating); \\u00a7\\u00a7 300gg-1, 300gg-3, 300gg-4(a) (guaranteed issue); \\u00a7 300gg-11 (elimination of coverage limits); \\u00a7 300gg-14(a) (dependent children up to age 26); ACA \\u00a7\\u00a7 9010, 10905, 124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); HCERA \\u00a7 1401, 124 Stat. 1059 (excise tax).\\n\\nThe Court has been informed by distinguished economists that the Act\\u2019s Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance industry by about $350 billion over 10 years; that this combined figure of $700 billion is necessary to offset the approximately $700 billion in new costs to the insurance industry imposed by the Act\\u2019s insurance regulations and taxes; and that the new $700-billion burden would otherwise dwarf the industry\\u2019s current profit margin. See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11-393 etc. (Severability), pp. 9-16, 10a.\\n\\nIf that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will mean higher costs for insurance companies. Higher costs may mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the Act\\u2019s goal of \\u201clowering] health insurance premiums.\\u201d 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Higher costs also could threaten the survival of health insurance companies, despite *699the Act\\u2019s goal of \\u201ceffective health insurance markets.\\u201d \\u00a7 18091(2)(J).\\n\\nThe actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be more or less than predicted. What is known, however, is that severing other provisions from the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance companies, their customers, all other major actors in the system, and the government treasury. And what also is known is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertainties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability and thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the Nation\\u2019s freedom. If those risks and uncertainties are to be imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.\\n\\nb\\n\\nReductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Federal Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion over 10 years. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)-(xii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); \\u00a7 1395ww(q); \\u00a7 1395ww(r); \\u00a7 1396r-4(f)(7).\\n\\nThe concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage will reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hospitals\\u2019 revenues, which will offset the government\\u2019s reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and benefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole dynamic of the Act.\\n\\nInvalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insurance coverage, such as community rating and the Medicaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA\\u2019s design of \\u201cshared responsibility.\\u201d Some hospitals may be forced to raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance premiums, in contravention of the Act\\u2019s goal of \\u201clowering] health insurance premiums.\\u201d *70042 U.S.C. \\u00a7 18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). See also \\u00a7 18091(2)(I) (goal of \\u201clowering] health insurance premiums\\u201d); \\u00a7 18091(2)(J) (same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced to shut down. Cf. Nat. Assn, of Public Hospitals, 2009 Annual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 6-6 (Feb. 2011). Like the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure nor predict. And Congress could not have intended that result in any event.\\n\\nThere is a second, independent reason why the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA\\u2019s other Medicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA\\u2019s $465 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Estimate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed Congress to find that the ACA \\u201cwill reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\\u201d and \\u201cwill continue to reduce budget deficits after 2019.\\u201d ACA \\u00a7\\u00a7 1563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\\n\\nThat finding was critical to the ACA. The Act\\u2019s \\u201cshared responsibility\\u201d concept extends to the federal budget. Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with budget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United States has explained in the course of this litigation that \\u201c[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provisions.\\u201d Memorandum in Support of Government\\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 3-10-cv-91 (DC ND Fla.), p. 41.\\n\\nIf the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer be needed to offset the costs of the Medicaid Expansion, the reductions would no longer operate in the manner Congress *701intended. They would lose their justification and foundation. In addition, to preserve them would be \\u201cto eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative compromise\\u201d and create a statute Congress did not enact. Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 561 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting). It is no secret that cutting Medicare is unpopular; and it is most improbable Congress would have done so without at least the assurance that it would render the ACA deficit neutral. See ACA \\u00a7\\u00a7 1563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\\n\\nc\\n\\nHealth Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal Subsidies\\n\\nThe ACA requires each State to establish a health insurance \\u201cexchange.\\u201d Each exchange is a one-stop marketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare community-rated health insurance and purchase the policy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate, Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot remain in force.\\n\\nThe Act\\u2019s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars to subsidize individuals\\u2019 purchases on the exchanges. Individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance to the individual purchaser. 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 36B (2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV). By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person. See CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010, pp. 18-19 (Mar. 30, 2011). Without the community-rating insurance regulation, however, the average federal subsidy could be much higher; for community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay. Federal subsidies would make up much of the difference.\\n\\n*702The result would be an unintended boon to insurance companies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and a corresponding breakdown of the \\u201cshared responsibility\\u201d between the industry and the federal budget that Congress intended. Thus, the federal subsidies must be invalidated.\\n\\nIn the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges. Under the ACA\\u2019s scheme, few, if any, individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the exchanges\\u2019 onerous regulations. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 18031. That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\\n\\nThere is a second reason why, if community rating is invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\\u2019s invalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner consistent with the Act\\u2019s design. A key purpose of an exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options where prices are standardized regardless of the buyer\\u2019s pre-existing conditions. See ibid. An individual who shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate different insurance products. The products will offer different benefits and prices. Congress designed the exchanges so the shopper can compare benefits and prices. But the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress designed if the prices depend on the shopper\\u2019s pre-existing health conditions. The prices would vary from person to person. So without community rating\\u2014which prohibits insurers from basing the price of in*703surance on pre-existing conditions\\u2014the exchanges cannot operate in the manner Congress intended.\\n\\nd\\n\\nEmployer-Responsibility Assessment\\n\\nThe employer-responsibility assessment provides an incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to provide their employees with health insurance options that meet minimum criteria. See 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 4980H (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Unlike the Individual Mandate, the employer-responsibility assessment does not require employers to provide an insurance option. Instead, it requires them to make a payment to the Federal Government if they do not offer insurance to employees and if insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who qualifies for the exchange\\u2019s federal subsidies. See ibid.\\n\\nFor two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment must be invalidated. First, the ACA makes a direct link between the employer-responsibility assessment and the exchanges. The financial assessment against employers occurs only under certain conditions. One of them is the purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange. With no exchanges, there are no purchases on the exchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is nothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.\\n\\nSecond, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals (the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regulations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the Federal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges and for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reductions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-responsibility assessment would upset the ACA\\u2019s design of \\u201cshared responsibility.\\u201d It would leave employers as the only parties bearing any significant responsibility. That was not the congressional intent.\\n\\n*7042\\n\\nThe Act\\u2019s Minor Provisions\\n\\nThe next question is whether the invalidation of the ACA\\u2019s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate the ACA\\u2019s other provisions. It does.\\n\\nThe ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include requirements ranging from a break time and secluded place at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. \\u00a7 207(r)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content at chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. \\u00a7 343(q)(5)(H) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, including exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA \\u00a7\\u00a7 9015, 10906, 124 Stat. 870, 1020; HCERA \\u00a7 1402, 124 Stat. 1060, medical devices, see 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 4191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths, see \\u00a7 5000B. It spends government money on, among other things, the study of how to spend less government money. 42 U. S. C. \\u00a7 1315a (2006 ed., Supp. IV). And it includes a number of provisions that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator. For example, \\u00a7 10323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in Libby, Montana. Another provision, \\u00a7 2006, id., at 284, increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.\\n\\nSuch provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader\\u2019s statement, \\u201c T don\\u2019t know if there is a senator that doesn\\u2019t have something in this bill that was important to them.. . . [And] if they don\\u2019t have something in it important to them, then it doesn\\u2019t speak well of them. That\\u2019s what this legislation is all about: It\\u2019s the art of compromise.\\u2019\\u201d Pear, In Health Bill for Everyone, Provisions for a Few, N. Y. Times, Jan. 4, 2010, p. A10 (quoting Sen. Reid). Often, a minor provision will be the price paid for support of a major provision. So, if the major provision were unconstitutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.\\n\\n*705Without the ACA\\u2019s major provisions, many of these minor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress intended. For example, the tax increases are \\u201cRevenue Offset Provisions\\u201d designed to help offset the cost to the Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges\\u2019 federal subsidies. See Title IX, Subtitle A\\u2014 Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847. With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invalidated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs, and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act\\u2019s scheme of \\u201cshared responsibility\\u201d that Congress intended.\\n\\nSome provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently. The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the context of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unrelated\\u2014hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support. When we are confronted with such a so-called \\u201cChristmas tree,\\u201d a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which. To sever the statute in that manner \\u201c \\u2018would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is not part of our duty.\\u2019\\u201d Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S., at 99.\\n\\nThis Court must not impose risks unintended by Congress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the support *706to enact. For those reasons, the unconstitutionality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid Expansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s other provisions.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe Court today decides to save a statute Congress did not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cutoff of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cutoff of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available.\\n\\nThe Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health care regulation that Congress did not enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment of sensible health care regulation more difficult, since Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court\\u2019s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.\\n\\nThe Court\\u2019s disposition, invented and atextual as it is, does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional difficulties. It creates them. The holding that the Individual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional question (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves with inadequate deliberation. And the judgment on the Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism concerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union. Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must subsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid Expansion. If that destabilizing political dynamic, so antagonistic to a harmonious Union, is *707to be introduced at all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.\\n\\nThe values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers. But the Court\\u2019s ruling undermines those values at every turn. In the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional questions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.\\n\\nThe Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times. The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure. Structural protections\\u2014notably, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers\\u2014are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments. Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most important ones, for which reason they alone were embodied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today\\u2019s decision should have vindicated, should have taught, this truth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.\\n\\nFor the reasons here stated, we would find the Act invalid in its entirety. We respectfully dissent.\\n\\nThe most authoritative legal dictionaries of the founding era lack any definition for \\u201cregulate\\u201d or \\u201cregulation,\\u201d suggesting that the term bears its ordinary meaning (rather than some specialized legal meaning) in the *650constitutional text. See 2 R. Burn, A New Law Dictionary 281 (1792); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (10th ed. 1782); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg is therefore right to note that Congress is \\u201cnot mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.\\u201d Ante, at 608 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part). Instead, it is mandating the purchase of an unwanted suite of products\\u2014e.g., physician office visits, emergency room visits, hospital room and board, physical therapy, durable medical equipment, mental health care, and substance abuse detoxification. See Selected Medical Benefits: A Report From the Dept, of Labor to the Dept, of Health and Human Services (Apr. 15, 2011) (reporting that over two-thirds of private industry health plans cover these goods and services), online at http://www.bls.gov/nes/ebs/sp/selmedbensreport.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\\u2019s case file).\\n\\nIn its effort to show the contrary, Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s dissent comes up with nothing more than two condemnation eases, which it says demonstrate \\u201cCongress\\u2019 authority under the commerce power to compel an \\u2018inactive\\u2019 landholder to submit to an unwanted sale.\\u201d Ante, at 611. Wrong on both scores. As its name suggests, the condemnation power does not \\u201ccompel\\u201d anyone to do anything. It acts in rent, against the property that is condemned, and is effective with or without a transfer of title from the former owner. More important, the power to condemn for public use is a separate sovereign power, explicitly acknowledged in the Fifth Amendment, which provides that \\u201cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\\u201d\\n\\nThus, the power to condemn tends to refute rather than support the power to compel purchase of unwanted goods at a prescribed price: The latter is rather like the power to condemn cash for public use. If it existed, why would it not (like the condemnation power) be accompanied by a requirement of fair compensation for the portion of the exacted price that exceeds the goods\\u2019 fair market value (here, the difference between what the free market would charge for a health insurance policy on a young, healthy person with no pre-existing conditions, and the government-exacted community-rated premium)?\\n\\nNo one seriously contends that any of Congress\\u2019 other enumerated powers gives it the authority to enact \\u00a7 5000A as a regulation.\\n\\nOf course it can be both for statutory purposes, since Congress can define \\u201ctax\\u201d and \\u201cpenalty\\u201d in its enactments any way it wishes. That is why United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268 (1978), does not disprove our statement. That case held that a \\u201cpenalty\\u201d for willful failure to pay one\\u2019s taxes was included among the \\u201ctaxes\\u201d made nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. Id., at 273-275. Whether the \\u201cpenalty\\u201d was a \\u201ctax\\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code had absolutely no bearing on whether it escaped the constitutional limitations on penalties.\\n\\nThe amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the Anti-Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for failing to comply with the mandate \\u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68,\\u201d 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 5000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that such penalties \\u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes,\\u201d \\u00a7 6671(a) (2006 ed.). But that point seems to us to confirm the inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act. That the penalty is to be \\u201cassessed and collected in the same manner as taxes\\u201d refutes the proposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with respect to the Anti-Injunction Act. Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment shall be \\u201cassessed and collected\\u201d in the same manner as a tax and that no suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of the payment. See, e.g., \\u00a7\\u00a7 7421(b)(1), 6901(a); \\u00a7\\u00a7 6306(a), (b). The latter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the Anti-Injunction Act.\\n\\nAmicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax because it is an assessable penalty, and the Code\\u2019s assessment provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess \\u201call taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) imposed by this title.\\u201d \\u00a7 6201(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). But the fact that such items are included as \\u201ctaxes\\u201d for purposes of assessment does not establish that they are included as \\u201ctaxes\\u201d for purposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act, that do not contain similar \\u201cincluding\\u201d language.\\n\\n\\u201cState expenditures\\u201d is used here to mean annual expenditures from the States\\u2019 own funding sources, and it excludes federal grants unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nThis number is expressed in billions of Fiscal Year 2005 dollars.\\n\\nSee Office of Management and Budget, Historical Tables, Budget of the U. S.

This is true as a formal matter. \\u201cWhen the United States Government taxes United States citizens, it taxes them \\u2018in their individual capacities\\u2019 as \\u2018the people of America\\u2019\\u2014not as residents of a particular State.\\u201d Ibid. (quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 839 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring); some internal quotation marks omitted). But unless Justice Ginsburg thinks that there is no limit to the amount of money that can be squeezed out of taxpayers, heavy federal taxation diminishes the practical ability of States to collect their own taxes.\\n\\nThe Federal Government has a higher number for federal spending on Medicaid. According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal grants to the States for Medicaid amounted to nearly $273 billion in Fiscal Year 2010. See Office of Management and Budget, Historical Tables, Budget of the U. S. Government, Fiscal Year 2013, Table 12.3\\u2014Total Outlays for Grants to State and Local Governments by Function, Agency, and Program: 1940-2013, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals. In that fiscal year, total federal outlays for grants to state and local governments amounted to over $608 billion, see Table 12.1, and state and local government expenditures from their own sources amounted to $1.6 trillion, see Table 15.2. Using these numbers, 44.8% of all federal outlays to both state and local governments was allocated to Medicaid, amounting to 16.8% of all state and local expenditures from their own sources.\\n\\nThe Federal Government reports a higher percentage. According to Medicaid.gov, in Fiscal Year 2010, the Federal Government made Medicaid payments in the amount of nearly $260 billion, representing 67.79% of total *683Medicaid payments of $383 billion.

National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 209 (1982) (citing Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, \\u00a7\\u00a7301, 313, 43 Stat. 1070,1074). During the debates preceding that amendment, a leading Senator characterized \\u201c\\u2018the apparent hold on political parties which business interests and certain organizations seek and sometimes obtain by reason of liberal campaign contributions\\u2019 \\u201d as \\u201c \\u2018one of the great political evils of the time.\\u2019 \\u201d Automobile Workers, supra, at 576 (quoting 65 Cong. Rec. 9507-9508 (1924)). We upheld the amended statute against a constitutional challenge, observing that \\u201c[t]he power of Congress to protect the election of President and Vice President from corruption being clear, the choice of means to that end presents a question primarily addressed to the judgment of Congress.\\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 547 (1934).\\n\\nCongress\\u2019 historical concern with the \\u201cpolitical potentialities of wealth\\u201d and their \\u201cuntoward consequences for the democratic process,\\u201d Automobile Workers, supra, at 577-578, has long reached beyond corporate money. During and shortly after World War II, Congress reacted to the \\u201cenormous financial outlays\\u201d made by some unions in connection with national elections. 352 U. S., at 579. Congress first restricted union contributions in the Hatch Act, 18 U. S. C. \\u00a7 610,2 and it later prohibited \\u201cunion contributions in connec*117tion with federal elections . . . altogether.\\u201d National Right to Work, supra, at 209 (citing War Labor Disputes Act (Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act), ch. 144, \\u00a79, 57 Stat. 167). Congress subsequently extended that prohibition to cover unions\\u2019 election-related expenditures as well as contributions, and it broadened the coverage of federal campaigns to include both primary and general elections. Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act), 61 Stat. 136. See Automobile Workers, supra, at 578-584. During the consideration of those measures, legislators repeatedly voiced their concerns regarding the pernicious influence of large campaign contributions. See 93 Cong. Rec. 3428, 3522 (1947); H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947); S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2 (1947); H. R. Rep. No. 2093, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1945). As we noted in a unanimous opinion recalling this history, Congress\\u2019 \\\"careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a \\u2018cautious advance, step by step,\\u2019 to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations and labor organizations warrants considerable deference.\\u201d National Right to Work, supra, at 209 (citations omitted).\\n\\nIn early 1972 Congress continued its steady improvement of the national election laws by enacting FECA, 86 Stat. 3. As first enacted, that statute required disclosure of all contri*118butions exceeding $100 and of expenditures by candidates and political committees that spent more than $1,000 per year. Id., at 11-19. It also prohibited contributions made in the name of another person, id., at 19, and by Government contractors, id., at 10. The law ratified the earlier prohibition on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds for political contributions and expenditures, but it expressly permitted corporations and unions to establish and administer separate segregated funds (commonly known as political action committees, or PACs) for election-related contributions and expenditures. Id., at 12-13.3 See Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 409-410 (1972).\\n\\nAs the 1972 Presidential elections made clear, however, FECA\\u2019s passage did not deter unseemly fundraising and campaign practices. Evidence of those practices persuaded Congress to enact the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 1263. Reviewing a constitu-. tional challenge to the amendments, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit described them as \\u201cby far the most comprehensive . . . reform legislation [ever] passed by Congress concerning the election of the President, Vice-President and members of Congress.\\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 831 (1975) (en banc) (per curiam).\\n\\nThe 1974 amendments closed the loophole that had allowed candidates to use an unlimited number of political committees for fundraising purposes and thereby to circumvent the limits on individual committees\\u2019 receipts and disbursements. They also limited individual political contributions to any single candidate to $1,000 per election, with an overall annual limitation of $25,000 by any contributor; imposed ceilings on spending by candidates and political parties for national con*119ventions; required reporting and public disclosure of contributions and expenditures exceeding certain limits; and established the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to administer and enforce the legislation. Id., at 831-834.\\n\\nThe Court of Appeals upheld the 1974 in their entirety.4 It concluded that the clear and compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process provided a sufficient basis for sustaining the substantive provisions of the Act. Id., at 841. The court\\u2019s opinion relied heavily on findings that large contributions facilitated access to public officials5 and described methods of evading the con*120tribution limits that had enabled contributors of massive sums to avoid disclosure. Id., at 837-841.6\\n\\nThe Court of Appeals upheld the provisions establishing contribution and expenditure limitations on the theory that they should be viewed as regulations of conduct rather than speech. Id., at 840-841 (citing United States v. O\\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968)). This Court, however, concluded that each set of limitations raised serious \\u2014 though different \\u2014 concerns under the First Amendment. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14-23 (1976) (per curiam). We treated the limitations on candidate and individual expenditures as direct restraints on speech, but we observed that the contribution limitations, in contrast, imposed only \\u201ca marginal restriction upon the contributor\\u2019s ability to engage in free communication.\\u201d Id., at 20-21. Considering the \\u201cdeeply disturbing examples\\u201d of corruption related to candidate contributions discussed in the Court of Appeals\\u2019 opinion, we determined that limiting contributions served an interest in protecting \\u201cthe integrity of our system of representative democracy.\\u201d Id., at 26-27. In the end, the Act\\u2019s primary purpose \\u2014 \\u201cto limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions\\u201d \\u2014 pro*121vided \\u201ca constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.\\u201d Id., at 26.\\n\\nWe prefaced our analysis of the $1,000 limitation on expenditures by observing that it broadly encompassed every expenditure \\u201c\\u2018relative to a clearly identified candidate.\\u2019\\u201d Id., at 39 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \\u00a7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV)). To avoid vagueness concerns we construed that phrase to apply only to \\u201ccommunications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 42-44. We concluded, however, that as so narrowed, the provision would not provide effective protection against the dangers of quid pro quo arrangements, because persons and groups could eschew expenditures that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate while remaining \\u201cfree to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.\\u201d Id., at 45. We also rejected the argument that the expenditure limits were necessary to prevent attempts to circumvent the Act\\u2019s contribution limits, because FECA already treated expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate as contributions, and we were not persuaded that independent expenditures posed the same risk of real or apparent corruption as coordinated expenditures. Id., at 46-47. We therefore held that Congress\\u2019 interest in preventing real or apparent corruption was inadequate to justify the heavy burdens on the freedoms of expression and association that the expenditure limits imposed.\\n\\nWe upheld all of the disclosure and reporting requirements in the Act that were challenged on appeal to this Court after finding that they vindicated three important interests: providing the electorate with relevant information about the candidates and their supporters; deterring actual corruption and discouraging the use of money for improper purposes; and facilitating enforcement of the prohibitions in the Act. Id., at 66-68. In order to avoid an overbreadth problem, however, we placed the same narrowing construction on the *122term \\u201cexpenditure\\u201d in the disclosure context that we had adopted in the context of the expenditure limitations. Thus, we construed the reporting requirement for persons making expenditures of more than $100 in a year \\u201cto reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\\u201d Id., at 80 (footnote omitted).\\n\\nOur opinion in Buckley addressed issues that primarily related to contributions and expenditures by individuals, since none of the parties challenged the prohibition on contributions by corporations and labor unions. We noted, however, that the statute authorized the use of corporate and union resources to form and administer segregated funds that could be used for political purposes. Id., at 28-29, n. 31; see also n. 3, supra.\\n\\nThree important developments in the years after our decision in Buckley persuaded Congress that further legislation was necessary to regulate the role that corporations, unions, and wealthy contributors play in the electoral process. As a preface to our discussion of the specific provisions of BCRA, we comment briefly on the increased importance of \\u201csoft money,\\u201d the proliferation of \\u201cissue ads,\\u201d and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections.\\n\\nSoft Money\\n\\nUnder FECA, \\u201ccontributions\\u201d must be made with funds that are subject to the Act\\u2019s disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations. Such funds are known as \\u201cfederal\\u201d or \\u201chard\\u201d money. FECA defines the term \\u201ccontribution,\\u201d however, to include only the gift or advance of anything of value \\u201cmade by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added). Donations made solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections are therefore unaffected by FECA\\u2019s requirements and prohibitions. *123As a result, prior to the enactment of BCRA, federal law permitted corporations and unions, as well as individuals who had already made the maximum permissible contributions to federal candid\\u00e1tes, to contribute \\u201cnonfederal money\\u201d \\u2014 also known as \\u201csoft money\\u201d \\u2014 to political parties for activities intended to influence state or local elections.\\n\\nShortly after Buckley was decided, questions arose concerning the treatment of contributions intended to influence both federal and state elections. Although a literal reading of FBCA\\u2019s definition of \\u201ccontribution\\u201d would have required such activities to be funded with hard money, the FEC ruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activities\\u2014 including get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising \\u2014 in part with soft money.7 In 1995 the FEC concluded that the parties could also use soft money to defray the costs of \\u201clegislative advocacy media advertisements,\\u201d even if the ads mentioned the name of a federal candidate, so long as *124they did not expressly advocate the candidate\\u2019s election or defeat. FEC Advisory Op. 1995-25.\\n\\nAs- the permissible uses of soft money expanded, the amount of soft money raised and spent by the national political parties increased exponentially. Of the two major parties\\u2019 total spending, soft money accounted for 5% ($21.6 million) in 1984, 11% ($45 million) in 1988, 16% ($80 million) in 1992, 30% ($272 million) in 1996, and 42% ($498 million) in 2000.8 The national parties transferred large amounts of their soft money to the state parties, which were allowed to use a larger percentage of soft money to finance mixed-purpose activities under FEC rules.9 In the year 2000, for example, the national parties diverted $280 million \\u2014 more than half of their soft money \\u2014 to state parties.\\n\\nMany contributions of soft money were dramatically larger than the contributions of hard money permitted by FECA. For example, in 1996 the top five corporate soft-money donors gave, in total, more than $9 million in nonfederal funds to the two national party committees.10 In the most recent election cycle the political parties raised almost $300 million \\u2014 60% of their total soft-money fundraising \\u2014 from just 800 donors, each of which contributed a minimum of $120,000.11 Moreover, the largest corporate donors often made substantial contributions to both parties.12 Such practices corroborate evidence indicating that many corporate contributions were motivated by a desire for access to candi*125dates and a fear of being placed at a disadvantage in the legislative process relative to other contributors, rather than by ideological support for the candidates and parties.13\\n\\nNot only were such soft-money contributions often designed to gain access to federal candidates, but they were in many cases solicited by the candidates themselves. Candidates often directed potential donors to party committees and tax-exempt organizations that could legally accept soft money. For example, a federal legislator running for reelection solicited soft money from a supporter by advising him that even though he had already \\u201c \\u2018contributed the legal maximum\\u2019 \\u201d to the campaign committee, he could still make an additional contribution to a joint program supporting federal, state, and local candidates of his party.14 Such solicitations were not uncommon.15\\n\\n*126The solicitation, transfer, and use of soft money thus enabled parties and candidates to circumvent FECA\\u2019s limitations on the source and amount of contributions in connection with federal elections.\\n\\nIssue Advertising\\n\\nIn Buckley we construed FECA\\u2019s disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as its expenditure limitations, \\u201cto reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 80 (footnote omitted). As a result of that strict reading of the statute, the use or omission of \\u201cmagic words\\u201d such as \\u201cElect John Smith\\u201d or \\u201cVote Against Jane Doe\\u201d marked a bright statutory line separating \\u201cexpress advocacy\\u201d from \\u201cissue advocacy.\\u201d See id., at 44, n. 52. Express advocacy was subject to. FECA\\u2019s limitations and could be financed only using hard money. The political parties, in other words, could not use soft money to sponsor ads that used any magic words, and corporations and unions could not fund such ads out of their general treasuries. So-called issue ads, on the other hand, not only could be financed with soft money, but could be aired without disclosing the identity of, or any other information about, their sponsors.\\n\\nWhile the distinction between \\u201cissue\\u201d and express advocacy seemed neat in theory, the two categories of advertisements proved functionally identical in important respects. Both were used to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates, even though the so-called issue ads eschewed the use of magic words.16 Little difference *127existed, for example, between an ad that urged viewers to \\u201cvote against Jane Doe\\u201d and one that condemned Jane Doe\\u2019s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \\u201ccall Jane Doe and tell her what you think.\\u201d17 Indeed, campaign professionals testified that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products such as Coca-Cola, should, and did, avoid the use of the magic words.18 Moreover, the conclusion that such ads were specifically intended to affect election results was confirmed by the fact that almost all of them aired in the 60 days immediately preceding a federal election.19 Corporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads,20 and those expenditures, like *128soft-money donations to the political parties, were unregulated under FECA. Indeed, the ads were attractive to organizations and candidates precisely because they were beyond FECA\\u2019s reach, enabling candidates and their parties to work closely with friendly interest groups to sponsor so-called issue ads when the candidates themselves were running out of money.21\\n\\nBecause FECA\\u2019s disclosure requirements did not apply to so-called issue ads, sponsors of such ads often used misleading names to conceal their identity. \\u201cCitizens for Better Medicare,\\u201d for instance, was not a grassroots organization of citizens, as its name' might suggest, but was instead a platform for an association of drug manufacturers.22 And \\u201cRepublicans for Clean Air,\\u201d which ran ads in the 2000 Republican Presidential primary, was actually an organization consisting of just two individuals \\u2014 brothers who together spent $25 million on ads supporting their favored candidate.23\\n\\nWhile the public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads, the record indi*129cates that candidates and officeholders often were. A former Senator confirmed that candidates and officials knew who their friends were and \\u201c \\u2018sometimes suggested] that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups that run \\u201cissue ads.\\u201d \\u2019 \\u201d24 As with soft-money contributions, political parties and candidates used the availability of so-called issue ads to circumvent FECA\\u2019s limitations, asking donors who contributed their permitted quota of hard money to give money to nonprofit corporations to spend on \\u201cissue\\u201d advocacy.25\\n\\nSenate Committee Investigation\\n\\nIn 1998 the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a six-volume report summarizing the results of an extensive investigation into the campaign practices in the 1996 federal elections. The report gave particular attention to the effect of soft money on the American political system, including elected officials\\u2019 practice of granting special access in return for political contributions.\\n\\nThe committee\\u2019s principal findings relating to Democratic Party fundraising were set forth in the majority\\u2019s report, while the minority report primarily described Republican practices. The two reports reached consensus, however, on certain central propositions. They agreed that the \\u201csoft money loophole\\u201d had led to a \\u201cmeltdown\\u201d of the campaign finance system that had been intended \\u201cto keep corporate, union and large individual contributions from influencing the electoral process.\\u201d26 One Senator stated that \\u201cthe hearings provided overwhelming evidence that the twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue advertising have virtually de*130stroyed our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble.\\u201d27\\n\\nThe report was critical of both parties\\u2019 methods of raising soft money, as well as their use of those funds. It concluded that both parties promised and provided special access to candidates and senior Government officials in exchange for large soft-money contributions. The committee majority described the White House coffees that rewarded major donors with access to President Clinton,28 and the courtesies extended to an international businessman named Roger Tamraz, who candidly acknowledged that his donations of about $300,000 to the DNC and to state parties were motivated by his interest in gaining the Federal Government\\u2019s support for an oil-line project in the Caucasus.29 The minority described the promotional materials used by the RNC\\u2019s two principal donor programs, \\u201cTeam 100\\u201d and the \\u201cRepublican Eagles,\\u201d which promised \\u201cspecial access to high-ranking Republican elected officials, including governors, senators, and representatives.\\u201d30 One fundraising letter recited that the chairman of the RNC had personally escorted a donor on *131appointments that \\u201c 'turned out to be very significant in the legislation affecting public utility holding companies\\u2019\\u201d and made the donor \\u2018\\\"a hero in his industry.\\u2019\\u201d31\\n\\nIn 1996 both parties began to use large amounts of soft money to pay for issue advertising designed to influence federal elections. The committee found such ads highly problematic for two reasons. Since they accomplished the same purposes as express advocacy (which could lawfully be funded only with hard money), the ads enabled unions, corporations, and wealthy contributors to circumvent protections that FECA was intended, to provide. Moreover, though ostensibly independent of the candidates, the ads were often actually coordinated with, and controlled by, the campaigns.32 The ads thus provided a means for evading FECA\\u2019s candidate contribution limits.\\n\\nThe report also emphasized the role of state and local parties. While, the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime permitted national parties to use soft money to pay for up to 40% of the costs of both generic voter activities and issue advertising, they allowed state and local parties to use larger percentages of soft money for those purposes.33 For that reason, national parties often made substantial transfers of soft money to \\u201cstate and local political parties for \\u2018generic voter activities\\u2019 that in fact ultimately benefited] federal candidates because the funds for all practical purposes remained] under the control of the national committees.\\u201d The report concluded that \\u201c[t]he use of such soft money thus allow[ed] more corporate, union treasury, and large contributions from wealthy individuals into the system.\\u201d34\\n\\nThe report discussed potential reforms, including a ban on soft money at the national and state party levels and restric*132tions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups.35 The majority expressed the view that a ban on the raising of soft money by national party committees would effectively address the use of union and corporate general treasury funds in the federal political process only if it required that candidate-specific ads be funded with hard money.36 The minority similarly recommended the elimination of soft-money contributions to political parties from individuals, corporations, and unions, as well as \\u201creforms addressing candidate advertisements masquerading as issue ads.\\u201d37\\n\\n> \\u2014 1\\n\\nIn BCRA, Congress enacted many of the committee s proposed reforms. BCRA\\u2019s central provisions are designed to address Congress\\u2019 concerns about the increasing use of soft money and issue advertising to influence federal elections. Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates. Title II primarily prohibits corporations and labor unions from using general treasury funds for communications that are intended to, or have the effect of, influencing the outcome of federal elections.\\n\\nSection 403 of BCRA provides special rules for actions challenging the constitutionality of any of the Act\\u2019s provisions. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 437h note (Supp. II). Eleven such actions were filed promptly after the statute went into effect in March 2002. As required by \\u00a7403, those actions were filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia and heard by a three-judge court. Section 403 directed the District Court to advance the cases on the docket and to expedite their disposition \\u201cto the greatest possible extent.\\u201d The court received a voluminous record compiled by the parties and ultimately delivered a decision embodied in a two-judge per curiam opinion and three separate,. lengthy opinions, *133each of which contained extensive commentary on the facts and a careful analysis of the legal issues. 251 F. Supp. 2d 176 (2003). The three judges reached unanimity on certain issues but differed on many. Their judgment, entered on May 1, 2003, held some parts of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others. 251 F. Supp. 2d 948.\\n\\nAs authorized by \\u00a7 403, all of the losing parties filed direct appeals to this Court within 10 days. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 437h note. On June 5, 2003, we noted probable jurisdiction and ordered the parties to comply with an expedited briefing schedule and present their oral arguments at a special hearing on September 8, 2003. 539 U. S. 911. To simplify the presentation, we directed the parties challenging provisions of BCRA to proceed first on all issues, whether or not they prevailed on any issue in the District Court. Ibid. Mindful of \\u00a7403\\u2019s instruction that we expedite our disposition of these appeals to the greatest extent possible, we also consider each of the issues in order. Accordingly, we first, turn our attention to Title I of BCRA.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTitle I is Congress\\u2019 effort to plug the soft-money loophole. The cornerstone of Title I is new FECA \\u25a0\\u00a7 323(a), which prohibits national party committees and their agents from soliciting, receiving, directing, or spending any soft money. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(a) (Supp. II).38 In short, \\u00a7 323(a) takes national parties out of the soft-money business.\\n\\nThe remaining provisions of new FECA \\u00a7323 largely reinforce the restrictions in \\u00a7 323(a). New FECA \\u00a7 323(b) prevents the wholesale shift of soft-money influence from *134national to state party committees by prohibiting state and local party committees from using such funds for activities that affect federal elections. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(b). These \\u201cFederal election activities],\\u201d defined in new FECA \\u00a7 301(20)(A), are almost identical to the mixed-purpose activities that have long been regulated under the FEC\\u2019s pre-BCRA allocation regime. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(20)(A). New FECA \\u00a7 323(d) reinforces these soft-money restrictions by prohibiting political parties from soliciting and donating funds to tax-exempt organizations that engage in electioneering activities. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d). New FECA \\u00a7 323(e) restricts federal candidates and officeholders from receiving, spending, or soliciting soft money in connection with federal elections and limits their ability to do so in connection with state and local elections. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(e). Finally, new FECA \\u00a7 323(f) prevents circumvention of the restrictions on national, state, and local party committees by prohibiting state and local candidates from raising and spending soft money to fund advertisements and other public communications that promote or attack federal candidates. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(f).\\n\\nPlaintiffs mount a facial First Amendment challenge to new FECA \\u00a7323, as well as challenges based on the Elections Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a74, principles of federalism, and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. We address these challenges in turn.\\n\\nA\\n\\nIn Buckley and subsequent cases, we have subjected restrictions on campaign expenditures to closer scrutiny than limits on campaign contributions. See, e. g., Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146, 161 (2003); see also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387-388 (2000); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 19. In these cases we have recognized that contribution limits, unlike limits on expenditures, \\u201centai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the *135contributor\\u2019s ability to engage in free communication.\\u201d Id., at 20; see also, e. g., Beaumont, supra, at 161; Shrink Missouri, supra, at 386-388. In Buckley we said:\\n\\n    \\u201cA contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support. The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of the contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing. At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor\\u2019s support for the candidate. A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and issues. While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 21 (footnote omitted).\\n\\nBecause.the communicative value of large contributions inheres mainly in their ability to facilitate the speech of their recipients, we have said that contribution limits impose serious burdens on free speech only if they are so low as to \\u201cprevent] candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\\u201d Ibid.\\n\\nWe have recognized that contribution limits may bear \\u201cmore heavily on the associational right than on freedom to speak,\\u201d Shrink Missouri, supra, at 388, since contributions serve \\u201cto affiliate a person with a candidate\\u201d and \\u201cenabl[e] like-minded persons to pool their resources,\\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 22. Unlike expenditure limits, however, which *136\\u201cpreclud[ej most associations from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents,\\u201d contribution limits both \\u201cleave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association\\u2019s efforts on behalf of candidates,\\u201d and allow associations \\u201cto aggregate large sums of money to promote effective advocacy.\\u201d Ibid. The \\u201coverall effect\\u201d of dollar limits on contributions is \\u201cmerely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.\\u201d Id., at 21-22. Thus, a contribution limit involving even \\u201c\\u2018significant interference\\u2019 \\u201d with associational rights is nevertheless valid if it satisfies the \\u201clesser demand\\u201d of being \\u201c \\u2018closely drawn\\u2019 \\u201d to match a \\u201c\\u2018sufficiently important interest.\\u2019\\u201d Beaumont, supra, at 162 (quoting Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-388).39\\n\\nOur treatment of contribution restrictions reflects more than the limited burdens they impose on First Amendment freedoms. It also reflects the importance of the interests that underlie contribution limits \\u2014 interests in preventing \\u201cboth the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.\\u201d National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 208; see also Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 440-441 (2001) (Colorado II). We have said that these interests directly implicate \\u201c\\u2018the integrity of our electoral process, and, not less, the responsibility of the individual citizen for the successful functioning *137of that process.\\u2019\\u201d National Right to Work, supra, at 208 (quoting Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 570). Because the electoral process is the very \\u201cmeans through which a free society democratically translates political speech into concrete governmental action,\\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 401 (Breyer, J., concurring), contribution limits, like other measures aimed at protecting the integrity of the process, tangibly benefit public participation in political debate. For that reason, when reviewing Congress\\u2019 decision to enact contribution limits, \\u201cthere is no place for a strong presumption against constitutionality, of the sort often thought to accompany the words \\u2018strict scrutiny.\\u2019\\u201d Id., at 400 (Breyer, J., concurring). The less rigorous standard of review we have applied to contribution limits (Buckley\\u2019s \\u201cclosely drawn\\u201d scrutiny) shows proper deference to Congress\\u2019 ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise. It also provides Congress with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the integrity of the political process.\\n\\nOur application of this less rigorous degree of scrutiny has given rise to significant criticism in the past from our dissenting colleagues. See, e. g., Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 405-410 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); id., at 410-420 (Thomas, J.; dissenting); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm\\u2019n, 518 U. S. 604, 635-644 (1996) (Colorado I) (Thomas, J., dissenting). We have rejected such criticism in previous cases for the reasons identified above. We are also mindful of the fact that in its lengthy deliberations leading to the enactment of BCRA, Congress properly relied on the recognition of its authority contained in Buckley and its progeny. Considerations of stare decisis, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe to one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits that the Court has consistently followed since Buckley *138was decided. See Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm\\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991).40\\n\\nLike the contribution limits we upheld in Buckley, \\u00a7 323\\u2019s restrictions have only a marginal impact on the ability of contributors, candidates, officeholders, and parties to engage in effective political speech. Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 161. Complex as its provisions may be, \\u00a7323, in the main, does little more than regulate the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders.\\n\\nPlaintiffs contend that we must apply strict scrutiny to \\u00a7 323 because many of its provisions restrict not only contributions but also the spending and solicitation of funds raised outside of FECA\\u2019s contribution limits. But for purposes of determining the level of scrutiny, it is irrelevant that Congress chose in \\u00a7 323 to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side. See, e.g., National Right to Work, supra, at 206-211 (upholding a provision restricting PACs\\u2019 ability to solicit funds). The relevant inquiry is whether the mechanism adopted to implement the contribu*139tion limit, or to prevent circumvention of that limit, burdens speech in a way that a direct restriction on the contribution itself would not. That is not the case here.\\n\\nFor example, while \\u00a7 323(a) prohibits national parties from receiving or spending nonfederal money, and \\u00a7 323(b) prohibits state party committees from spending nonfederal money on federal election activities, neither provision in any way limits the total amount of money parties can spend. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441i(a), (b) (Supp. II). Rather, they simply limit the source and individual amount of donations. That they do so by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render them expenditure limitations.41\\n\\nSimilarly, the solicitation provisions of \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(a) and 323(e), which restrict the ability of national party committees, federal candidates, and federal officeholders to solicit nonfederal funds, leave open ample opportunities for soliciting federal funds on behalf of entities, subject to FECA\\u2019s source and amount restrictions. Even \\u00a7 323(d), which on its face enacts a blanket ban on party solicitations of funds to certain tax-exempt organizations, nevertheless allows parties to solicit funds to the organizations\\u2019 federal PACs. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d). As for those organizations that cannot or do not administer PACs, parties remain free to donate federal funds directly to such organizations, and may solicit funds expressly for that purpose. See infra, at 180-181 (construing \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s restriction on donations by parties to apply only to donations from a party committee\\u2019s nonfederal or soft-money account). And as with \\u00a7 323(a), \\u00a7 323(d) places no limits on other means of endorsing tax-exempt organizations or any restrictions on solicitations by party officers acting in their individual capacities. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441i(a), (d).\\n\\nSection 323 thus shows \\u201cdue regard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative *140and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular, views.\\u201d Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 632 (1980). The fact that party committees and federal candidates and officeholders must now ask only for limited dollar amounts or request that a corporation or uni\\u00f3n contribute money through its PAC in no way alters or impairs the political message \\u201cintertwined\\u201d with the solicitation. Cf. Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795 (1988) (treating solicitation restriction that required fundraisers to disclose particular information as a content-based regulation subject to strict scrutiny because it \\u201cnecessarily alter[ed] the content of the speech\\u201d). And rather than chill such solicitations, as was the case in Schaumburg, the restriction here tends to increase the dissemination of information by forcing parties, candidates, and officeholders to solicit from a wider array of potential donors. As with direct limits on contributions, therefore, \\u00a7323\\u2019s spending and solicitation restrictions have only a marginal impact on political speech.42\\n\\n*141Finally, plaintiffs contend that the type of associational burdens that \\u00a7 323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied Buckley\\u2019s contribution limits, and merit the type of strict scrutiny we have applied to attempts to regulate the internal processes of political parties. E. g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 573-574 (2000). In making this argument, plaintiffs greatly exaggerate the effect of \\u00a7323, contending that it precludes any collaboration among national, state, and local committees of the same party in fundraising and electioneering activities. We do not read the provisions in that way. See infra, at 161. Section 323 merely subjects a greater percentage of contributions to parties and candidates to FECA\\u2019s source and amount limitations. Buckley has already acknowledged that such limitations \\u201cleave the contributor free to become a member of any political- association and to assist personally in the association\\u2019s efforts on behalf of candidates.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 22. The modest impact that \\u00a7 323 has on the ability of committees within a party to associate with each other does not independently occasion strict scrutiny. None of this is to suggest that the alleged associational burdens imposed on parties by \\u00a7323 have no place in the First Amendment analysis; it is only that we account for them in the application, rather than the choice, of the appropriate level of scrutiny.43\\n\\nWith these principies in mind, we apply the less rigorous scrutiny applicable to contribution limits to evaluate the constitutionality of new FECA \\u00a7 323. Because the. five *142challenged provisions of \\u00a7323 implicate different First Amendment concerns, we discuss them separately. We are mindful, however, that Congress enacted \\u00a7323 as an integrated whole to vindicate the Government\\u2019s important interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.\\n\\nNew FECA \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s Restrictions on National Party Committees\\n\\nThe core of Title I is new FECA \\u00a7 323(a), which provides that \\u201cnational committee[s] of a political party . . . may not solicit, receive, or direct to another person a contribution, donation, or transfer of funds or any other thing of value, or spend any funds, that are not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(a)(l) (Supp. II). The prohibition extends to \\u201cany officer or agent acting on behalf of such a national committee, and any entity that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a national committee.\\u201d \\u00a7441i(a)(2).\\n\\nThe main goal of \\u00a7 323(a) is modest. In large part, it simply effects a return to the scheme that was approved in Buckley and that was subverted by the creation of the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime, which permitted the political parties to fund federal electioneering efforts with a combination of hard and soft money. See supra, at 123-125, and n. 7. Under that allocation regime, national parties were able to use vast amounts of soft money in their efforts to elect federal candidates. Consequently, as long as they directed the money to the political parties, donors could contribute large amounts of soft money for use in activities designed to influence federal elections.44 New \\u00a7 323(a) is designed to put a stop to that practice.\\n\\n*1431. Governmental Interests Underlying New FECA \\u00a7 323(a)\\n\\nThe Government defends \\u00a7 323(a)\\u2019s ban 6n national parties\\u2019 involvement with soft money as necessary to prevent the actual and apparent corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. Our cases have made clear that the prevention of corruption or its appearance constitutes a sufficiently important interest to justify political contribution limits. We have not limited that interest to the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In Buckley, we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA\\u2019s contribution limits, noting that such laws \\u201cdeal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 28. Thus, \\u201c[i]n speaking of \\u2018improper influence\\u2019 and \\u2018opportunities for abuse\\u2019 in addition to \\u2018quid pro quo arrangements,\\u2019 we [have] recognized a concern not confined to bribery of public officials, but extending to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.\\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 389; see also Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441 (acknowledging that corruption extends beyond explicit cash-for-votes agreements to \\u201cundue influence on an officeholder\\u2019s judgment\\u201d).\\n\\nOf \\u201calmost equal\\u201d importance has been the Government\\u2019s interest in combating the appearance or perception of corruption engendered by large campaign contributions. *144Buckley, supra, at 27; see also Shrink Missouri, supra, at 390; Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 496-497 (1985). Take away Congress\\u2019 authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and \\u201cthe cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.\\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390; see also id., at 401 (Breyer, J., concurring). And because the First Amendment does not require Congress to ignore the fact that \\u201ccandidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the current law,\\u201d Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 457, these interests have been sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves, but laws preventing the circumvention of such limits, id., at 456 (\\u201c[A]ll Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption\\u201d).\\n\\n\\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.\\u201d Shrink Missouri, supra, at 391. The idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or, at the very least, create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible. For nearly 30 years, FECA has placed strict dollar limits and source restrictions on contributions that individuals and other entities can give to national, state, and local, party committees for the purpose of influencing a federal election. The premise behind these restrictions has been, and continues to be, that contributions to a federal candidate\\u2019s party in aid of that candidate\\u2019s campaign threaten to create \\u2014 no less than would a direct contribution to the candidate \\u2014 a sense of obligation. See Buckley, supra, at 38 (upholding FECA\\u2019s $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to a candidate, political committee, and political party committee as a \\u201cquite modest restraint... to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation\\u201d by, among *145other things, \\u201chuge contributions to the candidate\\u2019s political party\\u201d). This is particularly true of contributions to national parties, with which federal candidates and officeholders enjoy a special relationship and unity of interest. This close affiliation has placed national parties in a unique position, \\u201cwhether they like it or not,\\u201d to serve as \\u201cagents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce obligated officeholders.\\u201d Colorado II, supra, at 452; see also Shrink Missouri, supra, at 406 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\\u201c[Respondent] asks us to evaluate his speech claim in the context of a system which favors candidates and officeholders whose campaigns are supported by soft money, usually funneled through political parties\\u201d (emphasis added)). As discussed below, rather than resist that role, the national parties have actively embraced it.\\n\\nThe question for present purposes is whether large soft-money contributions to national party committees have a corrupting influence or give rise to the appearance of corruption. Both common sense and the ample record in these cases confirm Congress\\u2019 belief that they do. As set forth above, supra, at 123-125, and n. 7, the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime has invited widespread circumvention of FECA\\u2019s limits on contributions to parties for the purpose of influencing federal elections. Under this system, corporate, union, and wealthy individual donors have been free to contribute substantial sums of soft money to the national parties, which the parties can spend for the specific purpose of influencing a particular candidate\\u2019s federal election. It is not only plausible, but likely, that candidates would feel grateful for such donations and that donors would seek to exploit that gratitude.45\\n\\n*146The evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing intermediaries. Thus, despite FECA\\u2019s hard-money limits on direct contributions to candidates, federal officeholders have commonly asked donors to make soft-money donations to national and state committees \\u201c \\u2018solely in order to assist federal campaigns,\\u2019 \\u201d including the officeholder\\u2019s own. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 472 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting declaration of Wade Randlett, CEO, Dashboard Technology \\u00b6\\u00b66-9 (hereinafter Randlett Deck), App. 713-714); see also 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 471-473, 478-479 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 842-843 (Leon, J.). Parties kept tallies of the amounts of soft money raised by each officeholder, and \\u201cthe amount of money a Member of Congress raise[d] for the national political party committees often affect[ed] the amount the committees g[a]ve to assist the Member\\u2019s campaign.\\u201d Id., at 474-475 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.). Donors often asked that their contributions be credited to particular candidates, and the parties obliged, irrespective of whether the funds were hard or soft. Id., at 477-478 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 824, 847 (Leon, J.). National party committees often teamed with individual candidates\\u2019 campaign committees to create joint fundraising committees, which enabled the candidates to take advantage of the party\\u2019s higher contribution limits while still allowing donors to give to their preferred candidate. Id., at 478 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 847-848 (Leon, J.); see also App. 1286 (Krasno & Sorauf Expert Report (characterizing the joint fundraising committee as one *147\\u201cin which Senate candidates in effect rais[e] soft money for use in their own races\\u201d)). Even when not participating directly in the fundraising, federal officeholders were well aware of the identities of the donors: National party committees would distribute lists of potential or actual donors, or donors themselves would report their generosity to officeholders. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 487-488 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (\\u201c[F]or a Member not to know the identities of these donors, he or she must actively avoid such knowledge as it is provided by the national political parties and the donors themselves\\u201d); id., at 853-855 (Leon, J.).\\n\\nFor their part, lobbyists, CEOs, and wealthy individuals alike all have candidly admitted donating substantial sums of soft money to national committees not on ideological grounds, but for the express purpose of securing influence over federal officials. For example, a former lobbyist and partner at a lobbying firm in Washington, D. C., stated in his declaration:\\n\\n    \\u201c \\u2018You are doing a favor for somebody by making a large [soft money] donation and they appreciate it. Ordinarily, people feel inclined to reciprocate favors. Do a bigger favor for someone \\u2014 that is, write a larger check \\u2014 and they feel even more compelled to reciprocate. In my experience, overt words are rarely exchanged about contributions, but people do have understandings.\\u2019\\u201d Id., at 493 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting declaration of Robert Rozen, partner, Ernst & Young \\u00b6 14; see 8-R Defs. Exhs., Tab S3).46\\n\\n*148Particularly telling is the fact that, in 1996 and 2000, more than half of the top 50 soft-money donors gave substantial sums to both major national parties, leaving room for no other conclusion but that these donors were seeking influence, or avoiding retaliation, rather than promoting any particular ideology. See, e. g., 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 508-510 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (citing Mann Expert Report Tbls. 5-6); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 509 (\\u2018\\u201cGiving soft money to both parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, makes no sense at all unless the donor feels that he or she is buying access\\u2019 \\u201d (quoting declaration of former Sen. Dale Bumpers \\u00b6 15, App. 175)).47\\n\\n*149The evidence from the federal officeholders\\u2019 perspective is similar. For example, one former Senator described the influence purchased by nonfederal donations as follows:\\n\\n    \\u201c \\u2018Too often, Members\\u2019 first thought is not what is right or what they believe, but how it will affect fundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not alter the way one thinks about \\u2014 and quite possibly votes on \\u2014 an issue? . . . When you don\\u2019t pay the piper that finances your campaigns, you will never get any more money from that piper. Since money is the mother\\u2019s milk of politics, you never want to be in that situation.\\u2019\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 481 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting declaration of former Sen. Alan Simpson \\u00b6 10 (hereinafter Simpson Deck), App. 811); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 851 (Leon, J.) (same).\\n\\nSee also id., at 489 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (\\u201c\\u2018The majority of those who contribute to political parties do so for business reasons, to gain access to influential Members of Congress and to get to know new Members\\u2019 \\u201d (quoting Hickmott Decl., Exh. A, \\u00b6 46)). By bringing soft-money donors and federal candidates and officeholders together, \\u201c[p]arties are thus necessarily the instruments of some contributors whose object is not to support the party\\u2019s message or to elect party candidates across the board, but rather to support a specific candidate for the sake of a position on one narrow issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged to the contributors.\\u201d Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 451-452.\\n\\nPlaintiffs argue that without concrete evidence of an instance in which a federal officeholder has actually switched a vote (or, presumably, evidence of a specific instance where the public believes a vote was switched), Congress has not shown that there exists real or apparent corruption. But *150the record is to the contrary. The evidence connects soft money to manipulations of the legislative calendar, leading to Congress\\u2019 failure to enact, among other things, generic drug legislation, tort reform, and tobacco legislation. See, e. g., 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 482 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 852 (Leon, J.); App. 390-894 (declaration of Sen. John McCain \\u00b6\\u00b65, 8 \\u2014 11 (hereinafter McCain Decl.)); App. 811 (Simpson Decl. \\u00b6 10) (\\u201cDonations from the tobacco industry to Republicans scuttled tobacco legislation, just as contributions from the trial lawyers to Democrats stopped tort reform\\u201d); App. 805 (declaration of former Sen. Paul Simon \\u00b6\\u00b6 13-14). To claim that such actions do not change legislative outcomes surely misunderstands the legislative process.\\n\\nMore importantly, plaintiffs conceive of corruption too narrowly. Our cases have firmly established that Congress\\u2019 legitimate interest extends beyond preventing simple cash-for-votes corruption to curbing \\u201cundue influence on an officeholder\\u2019s judgment, and the appearance of such influence.\\u201d Colorado II, supra, at 441. Many of the \\u201cdeeply disturbing examples\\u201d of corruption cited by this Court in Buckley, 424 U. S., at 27, to justify FECA\\u2019s contribution limits were not episodes of vote buying, but evidence that various corporate interests had given substantial donations to gain access to high-level government officials. See Buckley, 519 F. 2d, at 839-840, n. 36; nn. 5-6, supra. Even if that access did not secure actual influence, it certainly gave the \\u201cappearance of such influence.\\u201d Colorado II, supra, at 441; see also 519 F. 2d, at 838.\\n\\nThe record in the present cases is replete with similar examples of national party committees peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations. See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 492-506 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).' As one former Senator put it:\\n\\n    \\u201c\\u2018Special interests who give large amounts of soft money to political parties do in fact achieve their objectives. They do get special access. Sitting Senators *151and House Members have limited amounts of time, but they make time available in their schedules to meet with representatives of business and unions and wealthy individuals who gave large sums to their parties. These are not idle chit-chats about the philosophy of democracy. . . . Senators are pressed by their benefactors to introduce legislation, to amend legislation, to block legislation, and to vote on legislation in a certain way.\\u2019\\u201d Id., at 496 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting declaration of former Sen. Warren Rudman \\u00b6 7 (hereinafter Rudman Deck), App. 742); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 858 (Leon, J.) (same).\\n\\nSo pervasive is this practice that the six national party committees actually furnish their own menus of opportunities for access to would-be soft-money donors, with increased prices reflecting an increased level of access. For example, the DCCC offers a range of donor options, starting with the $10,000-per-year Business Forum program, and going up to the $100,000-per-year National Finance Board program. The latter entitles the donor to bimonthly conference calls with the Democratic House leadership and chair of the DCCC, complimentary invitations to all DCCC fundraising events, two private dinners with the Democratic House leadership and ranking Members, and two retreats with the Democratic House leader and DCCC chair in Telluride, Colorado, and Hyannisport, Massachusetts. Id., at 504-505 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); see also id., at 506 (describing records indicating that DNC offered meetings with President in return for large donations); id., at 502-503 (describing RNC\\u2019s various donor programs); id., at 503-504 (same for NRSC); id., at 500-503 (same for DSCC); id., at 504 (same for NRCC). Similarly, \\u201cthe RNC\\u2019s donor programs offer greater access to federal office holders as the donations grow larger, with the highest level and most personal access offered to the largest soft money donors.\\u201d Id., at 500-503 (finding, further, that the RNC holds out the prospect of access to officeholders to attract soft-money donations and encourages *152officeholders to meet with large soft-money donors); accord, id., at 860-861 (Leon, J.).\\n\\nDespite this evidence and the close ties that candidates and officeholders have with their parties, Justice Kennedy would limit Congress\\u2019 regulatory interest only to the prevention of the actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption \\u201cinherent in\\u201d contributions made directly to, contributions made at the express behest of, and expenditures made in coordination with, a federal officeholder or candidate. Post, at 292, 298. Regulation of any other donation or expenditure \\u2014 regardless of its size, the recipient\\u2019s relationship to the candidate or officeholder, its potential impact on a candidate\\u2019s election, its value to the candidate, or its unabashed and explicit intent to purchase influence \\u2014 would, according to Justice Kennedy, simply be out of bounds. This crabbed view of corruption, and particularly of the appearance of corruption, ignores precedent, common sense, and the realities of political fundraising exposed by the record in this litigation.48\\n\\n*153Justice Kennedy\\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment would render Congress powerless to address more subtle but equally dispiriting forms of corruption. Just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the merits or the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder. Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize. The best means of prevention is to identify and to remove the temptation. The evidence set forth above, which is but a sampling of the reams of disquieting evidence contained in the record, convincingly demonstrates that soft-money contributions to political parties carry with them just such temptation.\\n\\nJustice Kennedy likewise takes too narrow a view of the appearance of corruption. He asserts that only those transactions with \\u201cinherent corruption potential,\\u201d which he again limits to contributions directly to candidates, justify the inference \\u201cthat regulating the conduct will stem the appearance of real corruption.\\u201d Post, at 297-298.49 In our view, however, Congress is not required to ignore historical evidence regarding a particular practice or to view conduct in isolation from its context. To \\u00a1be sure, mere politic! favoritism or opportunity for influence alone is insufficient to justify regulation. Ibid. As the record demonstrates, it is the manner in which parties have sold access to federal *154candidates and officeholders that has given rise to the appearance of undue influence. Implicit (and, as the record shows, sometimes explicit) in the sale of access is the suggestion that money buys influence. It is no surprise then that purchasers of such access unabashedly admit that they are seeking to purchase just such influence. It was not unwarranted for Congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance of corruption.\\n\\nIn sum, there is substantial evidence to support Congress\\u2019 determination that large soft-money contributions to national political parties give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.\\n\\n2. New FECA \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s Restriction on Spending and Receiving Soft Money\\n\\nPlaintiffs and The Chief Justice contend that \\u00a7 323(a) is impermissibly overbroad because it subjects all funds raised and spent by national parties to FECA\\u2019s hard-money source and amount limits, including, for example, funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.50 Post, at 353-354 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Such activities, The Chief Justice asserts, pose \\u201clittle or no potential to corrupt... federal candidates and officeholders.\\u201d Post, at 353 (dissenting opinion). This observation is beside the point. Section 323(a), like the remainder of \\u00a7 323, regulates contributions, not activities. As the record demonstrates, it is the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship, that have *155made all large soft-money contributions to national parties suspect.\\n\\nAs one expert noted, \\u201c \\u2018[t]here is no meaningful separation between the national party committees and the public officials who control them.\\u2019\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 468-469 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting Mann Expert Report 29). The national committees of the two major parties are both run by, and largely composed of, federal officeholders and candidates. Indeed, of the six national committees of the two major parties, four are composed entirely of federal officeholders. Ibid. The nexus between national parties and federal officeholders prompted one of Title I\\u2019s framers to conclude:\\n\\n    \\u201cBecause the national parties operate at the national level, and are inextricably intertwined with federal officeholders and candidates, who raise the money for the national party committees, there is a close connection between the fimding of the national parties and the corrupting dangers of soft money on the federal political process. The only effective way to address this [soft-money] problem of corruption is to ban entirely all raising and spending of soft money by the national parties.\\u201d 148 Cong. Rec. H409 (Feb. 13, 2002) (statement of Rep. Shays).\\n\\nGiven this close connection and alignment of interests, large soft-money contributions to national parties are likely to create actual or apparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.\\n\\nThis close affiliation has also placed national parties in a position to sell access to federal officeholders in exchange for soft-money contributions that the party can then use for its own purposes. Access to federal officeholders is the most valuable favor the national party committees are able to give in exchange for large donations. The fact that officeholders comply by donating their valuable time indicates either that *156officeholders place substantial value on the soft-money contribution themselves, without regard to their end use, or that national committees are able to exert considerable control over federal officeholders. See, e. g., App. 1196-1198 (Expert Report of Donald R Green, Yale University) (hereinafter Green Expert Report) (\\u201cOnce elected to legislative office, public officials enter an environment in which political parties-in-government control the resources crucial to subsequent electoral success and legislative power. Political parties organize the legislative caucuses that make committee assignments\\u201d); App. 1298 (Krasno & Sorauf Expert Report) (indicating that officeholders\\u2019 reelection prospects are significantly influenced by attitudes of party leadership). Either way, large soft-money donations to national party committees are likely to buy donors preferential access to federal officeholders no matter the ends to which their contributions are eventually put. As discussed, above, Congress had sufficient grounds to regulate the appearance of undue influence associated with this practice. The Government\\u2019s strong interests in preventing corruption, and in particular the appearance of corruption, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to the source, amount, and disclosure limitations of FECA.51\\n\\n*1573. New FECA \\u00a7S23(a)'s Restriction on Soliciting or Directing Soft Money\\n\\nPlaintiffs also contend that \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s prohibition on national parties\\u2019 soliciting or directing soft-money contributions is substantially overbroad. The reach of the solicitation prohibition, however, is limited. It bars only solicitations of soft money by national party committees and by party officers in their official capacities. The committees remain free to solicit hard money on their own behalf, as well as to solicit hard money on behalf of state committees and state and local candidates.52 They also can contribute hard money to state committees and to candidates. In accordance with FEC regulations,, furthermore, officers of national parties are free to solicit soft money in their individual capacities, or, if they are also officials of state parties, in that capacity. See 67 Fed. Reg. 49083 (2002).\\n\\nThis limited restriction on solicitation follows sensibly from the prohibition on national committees\\u2019 receiving soft money. The same observations that led us to approve the latter compel us to reach the same conclusion regarding the former. A national committee is likely to respond favorably to a donation made at its request regardless of whether the *158recipient is the committee itself or another entity. This principle accords with common sense and appears elsewhere in federal laws. E. g., 18 U. S. C. \\u00a7 201(b)(2) (prohibition on public officials \\u201cdemanding] [or] seeking] . . . anything of value personally or for any other person or entity ...\\u201d (emphasis added)); 5 CFR \\u00a7 2635.203(f)(2) (2003) (restriction on gifts to federal employees encompasses gifts \\u201c[g]iven to any other person, including any charitable organization, on the basis of designation, recommendation, or other specification by the employee\\u201d).\\n\\nPlaintiffs argue that BCRA itself demonstrates the over-breadth of \\u00a7 323(a)\\u2019s solicitation ban. They point in particular to \\u00a7 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited amounts of soft money from individual donors under certain circumstances. Compare 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(a) with \\u00a7441i(e) (Supp. II). The differences between \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(a) and 323(e), however, are without constitutional significance. We have recognized that \\u201cthe \\u2018differing structures and purposes\\u2019 of different entities \\u2018may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process,\\u2019 \\u201d National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210, and we respect Congress\\u2019 decision to proceed in incremental steps in the area of campaign finance regulation, see Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 258, n. 11 (1986) (MCFL); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 105. The differences between the two provisions reflect Congress\\u2019 reasonable judgments about the function played by national committees and the interactions between committees and officeholders, subjects about which Members of Congress have vastly superior knowledge.\\n\\n4. New FECA \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s Application to Minor Parties\\n\\nThe McConnell and political party plaintiffs contend that \\u00a7 323(a) is substantially overbroad and must be stricken on its face because it impermissibly infringes the speech and *159associational rights of minor parties such as the Libertarian National Committee, which, owing to their slim prospects for electoral success and the fact that they receive few large soft-money contributions from corporate sources, pose no threat of corruption comparable to that posed by the RNC and DNC. In Buckley, we rejected a similar argument concerning limits on contributions to minor-party candidates, noting that \\u201cany attempt to exclude minor parties and independents en masse from the Act\\u2019s contribution limitations overlooks the fact that minor-party candidates may win elective office or have a substantial impact on the outcome of an election.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 34-35. We have thus recognized that the relevance of the interest in avoiding actual or apparent corruption is not a function of the number of legislators a given party manages to elect. It applies as much to a minor party that manages to elect only one of its members to federal office as it does to a major party whose members make up a majority of Congress. It is therefore reasonable to require that all parties and all candidates follow the same set of rules designed to protect the integrity of the electoral process.\\n\\nWe add that nothing in \\u00a7 323(a) prevents individuals from pooling resources to start a new national party. Post, at 289 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Only when an organization has gained official status, which carries with it significant benefits for its members, will the proscriptions of \\u00a7 323(a) apply. Even then, a nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if \\u00a7 323(a) prevents it from \\u201camassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\\u201d Buckley, supra, at 21.\\n\\n5. New FECA \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s Associational Burdens\\n\\nFinally, plaintiffs assert that \\u00a7 323(a) is unconstitutional because it impermissibly interferes with the ability of national committees to associate with state and local committees. By way of example, plaintiffs point to the Republican *160Victory Plans, whereby the RNC acts in concert with the state and local committees of a given State to plan and implement joint, full-ticket fundraising and electioneering programs. See App. 693, 694-697 (declaration of John Pesch-ong, RNC Western Reg. Political Dir. (describing the Republican Victory Plans)). The political parties assert that \\u00a7 323(a) outlaws any participation in Victory Plans by RNC officers, including merely sitting down at a table and engaging in collective decisionmaking about how soft money will be solicited, received, and spent. Such associational burdens, they argue, are too great for the First Amendment to bear.\\n\\nWe are not persuaded by this argument because it hinges on an unnaturally broad reading of the terms \\u201cspend,\\u201d \\u201creceive,\\u201d \\u201cdirect,\\u201d and \\u201csolicit.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(a) (Supp. II). Nothing on the face of \\u00a7 323(a) prohibits national party officers, whether acting in their official or individual capacities, from sitting down with state and local party committees or candidates to plan and advise how to raise and spend soft money. As long as the national party officer does not personally spend, receive, direct, or solicit soft money, \\u00a7 323(a) permits a wide range of joint planning and electioneering activity. Intervenor-defendants, the principal drafters and proponents of the legislation, concede as much. Brief for Intervenor-Defendants Sen. John McCain et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p. 22 (\\u201cBCRA leaves parties and candidates free to coordinate campaign plans and activities, political messages, and fundraising goals with one another\\u201d). The FEC\\u2019s current definitions of \\u00a7 323(a)\\u2019s terms are consistent with that view. See, e.g., 11 CFR \\u00a7300.2(m) (2002) (defining \\u201csolicit\\u201d as \\u201cto ask . . . another person\\u201d (emphasis added)); \\u00a7 300.2(n) (defining \\u201cdirect\\u201d as \\u201cto ask a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution ... to make that contribution .. . including through a conduit or intermediary\\u201d (emphasis added)); \\u00a7 300.2(c) (laying out the factors *161that determine whether an entity will be considered to be controlled by a national committee).\\n\\nGiven the straightforward meaning of this provision, Justice Kennedy is incorrect that \\u201c[a] national party\\u2019s mere involvement in the strategic planning of fundraising for a state ballot initiative\\u201d or its assistance in developing a state party\\u2019s Levin-money fundraising efforts risks a finding that the officers are in \\u201c \\u2018indirect control\\u2019 \\u201d of the state party and subject to criminal penalties. Post, at 289. Moreover, \\u00a7 323(a) leaves national party committee officers entirely free to participate, in their official capacities, with state and local parties and candidates in soliciting and spending hard money; party officials may also solicit soft money in their unofficial capacities.\\n\\nAccordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\\u2019 First Amendment challenge to new FECA \\u00a7 323(a).\\n\\nNew FECA \\u00a7323(b)\\u2019s Restrictions on State and Local Party Committees\\n\\nIn constructing a coherent scheme of campaign finance regulation, Congress recognized that, given the close ties between federal candidates and state party committees, BCRA\\u2019s restrictions on national committee activity would rapidly become ineffective if state and local committees remained available as a conduit for soft-money donations,53 Section 323(b) is designed to foreclose wholesale evasion of \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s anticorruption measures by sharply curbing state committees\\u2019 ability to use large soft-money contributions to influence federal elections. The core of \\u00a7 323(b) is a straightforward contribution regulation: It prevents donors from *162contributing nonfederal funds to state and local party committees to help finance \\u201cFederal election activity.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(b)(l) (Supp. II). The term \\u201cFederal election activity\\u201d encompasses four distinct categories of electioneering: (1) voter registration activity during the 120 days preceding a regularly scheduled federal election; (2) voter identification, get-out-the-vote (GOTV), and generic campaign activity54 that is \\u201cconducted in connection with an election in which a candidate for Federal office appears on the ballot\\u201d; (3) any \\u201cpublic communication\\u201d55 that \\u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\\u201d and \\u201cpromotes,\\u201d \\u201csupports,\\u201d, \\u201cattacks,\\u201d or \\u201copposes\\u201d a candidate for that office; and (4) the services provided by a state committee employee who dedicates more than 25% of his or her time to \\u201cactivities in connection with a Federal election.\\u201d \\u00a7\\u00a7431(20)(A)(i)-(iv). The Act explicitly excludes several categories of activity from this definition: public communications that refer solely to nonfederal candidates;56 contributions to nonfederal candidates;57 state and local political conventions; and the cost of grassroots campaign materials like bumper stickers that refer only to state candidates. \\u00a7431(20)(B). All activities that fall within the statutory definition must be funded with hard money. \\u00a7441i(b)(l).\\n\\nSection 323(b)(2), the so-called Levin Amendment, carves out an exception to this general rule. A refinement on the pre-BCRA regime that permitted parties to pay for certain activities with a mix of federal and nonfederal funds, the *163Levin Amendment allows state and local party committees to pay for certain types of federal election activity with an allocated ratio of hard money and \\u201cLevin funds\\u201d \\u2014 that is, funds raised within an annual limit of $10,000 per person. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(b)(2). Except for the $10,000 cap and certain related restrictions to prevent circumvention of that limit, \\u00a7 323(b)(2) leaves regulation of such contributions to the States.58\\n\\nThe scope of the Levin Amendment is limited in two ways. First, state and local parties can use Levin money to fund only activities that fall within categories (1) and (2) of the statute\\u2019s definition of federal election activity \\u2014 namely, voter registration activity, voter identification drives, GOTV drives, and generic campaign activities. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(b)(2)(A). And not all of these activities qualify: Levin funds cannot be used to pay for any activities that refer to \\u201ca clearly identified candidate for Federal office\\u201d; they likewise cannot be used to fund broadcast communications unless they refer \\u201csolely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office.\\u201d \\u00a7\\u00a7 441i(b)(2)(B)(i) \\u2014 (ii).\\n\\nSecond, both the Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money used to pay for such activities must be raised entirely by the state or local committee that spends them. \\u00a7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv). This means that a state party committee cannot use Levin funds transferred from other party committees to cover the Levin ftmds portion of a Levin Amendment expenditure. It . also means that a state party committee cannot use hard money transferred from other party committees to cover the hard-money portion of a Levin Amendment expenditure. Furthermore, national committees, federal candidates, and federal officeholders generally may not solicit Levin ftmds on behalf of state committees, and state committees may not team up to raise Levin funds. *164\\u00a7 441i(b)(2)(C). They can, however, jointly raise the hard money used to make Levin expenditures.\\n\\n1. Governmental Interests Underlying New FECA 323(b)\\n\\nWe begin by noting that, in addressing the problem of soft-money contributions to state committees, Congress both drew a conclusion and made a prediction. Its conclusion, based on the evidence before it, was that the corrupting influence of soft money does not insinuate itself into the political process solely through national party committees. Rather, state committees function as an alternative avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.59 Indeed, both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached the limit on their direct contributions to donate to state committees.60 There is at least as much evidence as there was in *165Buckley that such donations have been made with the intent \\u2014 and in at least some cases the effect \\u2014 of gaining influence over federal officeholders.61 Section 323(b) thus promotes an important governmental interest by confronting the corrupting influence that soft-money donations to political parties already have.\\n\\nCongress also made a prediction. Having been taught the hard lesson of circumvention by the entire history of campaign finance regulation, Congress knew that soft-money donors would react to \\u00a7 323(a) . by scrambling to find another way to purchase influence. It was \\u201cneither novel nor implausible,\\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 391, for Congress to conclude that political parties would react to \\u00a7 323(a) by directing soft-money contributors to the state committees, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties. We \\u201cmust accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Congress,\\u201d Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,665 (1994) (plurality opinion), particularly when, as here, those predictions are so firmly rooted in relevant history and common sense. Preventing corrupting activity from shift*166ing wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating FECA clearly qualifies as an important governmental interest.\\n\\n2. New FECA \\u00a732S(b)\\u2019s Tailoring\\n\\nPlaintiffs argue that even if some legitimate interest might be served by \\u00a7 323(b), the provision\\u2019s restrictions are unjustifiably burdensome and therefore cannot be considered \\u201cclosely drawn\\u201d to match the Government\\u2019s objectives. They advance three main contentions in support of this proposition. First, they argue that the provision is substantially overbroad because it federalizes activities that pose no conceivable risk of corrupting or appearing to corrupt federal officeholders. Second, they argue that the Levin Amendment imposes an unconstitutional burden on the associational rights of political parties. Finally, they argue that the provision prevents them from amassing the resources they need to engage in effective advocacy. We address these points in turn.\\n\\na. \\u00a7323(b)\\u2019s Application to Federal Election Activity\\n\\nPlaintiffs assert that \\u00a7 323(b) represents a new brand of pervasive federal regulation of state-focused electioneering activities that cannot possibly corrupt or appear to corrupt federal officeholders and thus goes well beyond Congress\\u2019 concerns about the corruption of the federal electoral process. We disagree.\\n\\nIt is true that \\u00a7 323(b) captures some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices. But these are the same sorts of activities that already were covered by the FEC\\u2019s pre-BCRA allocation rules, and thus had to be funded in part by hard money, because they affect federal as well as state elections. See 11 CFR \\u00a7 106.5 (2002). As a practical matter, BCRA merely codifies the principles of the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime while at the same time justifiably adjusting the formulas applicable to these activities in order to restore *167the efficacy of FECA\\u2019s longtime statutory restriction \\u2014 approved by the Court and eroded by the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime \\u2014 on contributions to state and local party committees for the purpose of influencing federal elections. See 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7431(8)(A), 441a(a)(l)(C); see also Buckley, 424 U. S., at 38 (upholding FECA\\u2019s $25,000 limit on aggregate contributions to candidates and political committees); cf. California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm\\u2019n, 453 U. S. 182 (1981) (upholding FECA\\u2019s $5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political committees).\\n\\nLike the rest of Title I, \\u00a7 323(b) is premised on Congress\\u2019 judgment that if a large donation is capable of putting a federal candidate in the debt of the contributor, it poses a threat of corruption or the appearance of corruption. As we explain below, \\u00a7 323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that pose the greatest risk of this kind of corruption: those contributions to state and local parties that can be used to benefit federal candidates directly. Further, these regulations all are reasonably tailored, with various temporal and substantive limitations designed to focus the regulations on the important anticorruption interests to be served. We conclude that \\u00a7 323(b) is a closely drawn means of countering both corruption and the appearance of corruption.\\n\\nThe first two categories of \\u201cFederal election activity,\\u201d voter registration efforts, \\u00a7301(20)(A)(i), and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal election, \\u00a7 301(20)(A)(ii), clearly capture activity that benefits federal candidates. Common sense dictates, and it was \\u201cundisputed\\u201d below, that a party\\u2019s efforts to register voters sympathetic to that party directly assist the party\\u2019s candidates for federal office. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 460 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.). It is equally clear that federal candidates reap substantial rewards from any efforts that increase the number of like-minded registered voters who *168actually go to the polls.62 See, e. g., id., at 459 (\\u201c\\u2018[The evidence] shows quite clearly that a campaign that mobilizes residents of a highly Republican precinct will produce a harvest of votes for Republican candidates for both state and federal offices. A campaign need not mention federal candidates to have a direct effect on voting for such a candidate.... [G]eneric campaign activity has a direct effect on federal elections\\u2019\\u201d (quoting Green Expert Report 14)). Representatives of the four major congressional campaign committees confirmed that they \\u201c \\u2018transfe[r] federal and non-federal funds to state and/or local party committees for\\u2019\\u201d both voter registration and GOTV activities, and that \\u201c\\u2018[t]hese efforts have a significant effect on the election of federal candidates.\\u2019\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 459, 461 (citations omitted).\\n\\nThe record also makes quite clear that federal officeholders are grateful for contributions to state and local parties that can be converted into GOTV-type efforts. See id., at 459 (quoting a letter thanking a California Democratic Party donor and noting that CDP\\u2019s voter registration and GOTV efforts would help \\u201c\\u2018increase the number of Californian Democrats in the United States Congress\\u2019\\u201d and \\u201c\\u2018deliver California\\u2019s 54 electoral votes\\u2019 \\u201d to the Democratic Presidential candidate).\\n\\nBecause voter registration, voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity all confer substantial benefits on federal candidates, the funding of such activities creates a significant risk of actual and apparent corruption. Section 323(b) is a reasonable response to that risk. Its contribution limitations are focused on the subset of voter registration activity that is most likely to affect the election prospects of federal candidates: activity that occurs within 120 days before a federal election. And if the voter registration drive *169does not specifically mention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment\\u2019s higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 441i(b)(2)(B)(iHii) (Supp. II). Similarly, the contribution limits applicable to \\u00a7301(20)(A)(ii) activities target only those voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign efforts that occur \\u201cin connection with an election in which a candidate for a Federal office appears on the ballot.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(20)(A)(ii). Appropriately, in implementing this subsection, the FEC has categorically excluded all activity that takes place during the runup to elections when no federal office is at stake.63 Furthermore, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment\\u2019s higher contribution limits to fund any \\u00a7 301(A)(20)(i) and \\u00a7 301(A)(20)(ii) activities that do not specifically mention a federal candidate. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441i(b)(2)(B)(i)~(ii). The prohibition on the use of soft money in connection with these activities is therefore closely drawn to meet the sufficiently important governmental interests of avoiding corruption and its appearance.\\n\\n\\u201cPublic communications\\u201d that promote or attack a candidate for federal office \\u2014 the third category of \\u201cFederal election activity,\\u201d \\u00a7301(20)(A)(iii) \\u2014 also undoubtedly have a dramatic effect on federal elections. Such ads were a prime motivating force behind BCRA\\u2019s passage. See 3 1998 Senate Report 4535 (additional views of Sen. Collins) (\\u201c[TJhe *170hearings provided overwhelming evidence that the twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue advertising have virtually destroyed our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble\\u201d). As explained below, any public communication that promotes or attacks a clearly identified federal candidate directly affects the election in which he is participating. The record on this score could scarcely be more abundant. Given the overwhelming tendency of public communications, as carefully defined in \\u00a7 301(20)(A)(iii), to benefit directly federal candidates, we hold that application of \\u00a7 323(b)\\u2019s contribution caps to such communications is also closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.64\\n\\nAs for the final category of \\u201cFederal election activity,\\u201d \\u00a7 301(20)(A)(iv), we find that Congress\\u2019 interest in preventing circumvention of \\u00a7 323(b)\\u2019s other restrictions justifies the requirement that state and local parties spend federal funds to pay the salary of any employee spending more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities in connection with *171a federal election. In the absence of this provision, a party might use soft money to pay for the equivalent of a full-time employee engaged in federal electioneering, by the simple expedient of dividing the federal workload among multiple employees. Plaintiffs have suggested no reason for us to strike down this provision. Accordingly, we give \\u201cdeference to [the] congressional determination of the need for [this] prophylactic rule.\\u201d National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 500.\\n\\nb. Associational Burdens Imposed by the Levin Amendment\\n\\nPlaintiffs also contend that \\u00a7 323(b) is unconstitutional because the Levin Amendment unjustifiably burdens association among party committees by forbidding transfers of Levin funds among state parties, transfers of hard money to fund the allocable federal portion of Levin expenditures, and joint fundraising of Levin funds by state parties. We recognize, as we have in the past, the importance of preserving the associational freedom of parties. See, e. g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567 (2000); Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214 (1989). But not every minor restriction on parties\\u2019 otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension. See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.\\n\\nAs an initial matter, we note that state and local parties can avoid these associational burdens altogether by forgoing the Levin Amendment option and electing to pay for federal election activities entirely with hard money. But in any event, the restrictions on the use, transfer, and raising of Levin funds are justifiable anticircumvention measures. Without the ban on transfers of Levin funds among state committees, donors could readily circumvent the $10,000 limit on contributions to a committee\\u2019s Levin account by making multiple $10,000 donations to various committees that could then transfer the donations to the committee of *172choice.65 The same anticircumvention goal undergirds the ban on joint solicitation of Levin funds. Without this restriction, state and local committees could organize \\u201call hands\\u201d fundraisers at which individual, corporate, or union donors could make large soft-money donations to be divided between the committees. In that case, the purpose, if not the letter, of \\u00a7323(b)(2)'s $10,000 limit would be thwarted: Donors could make large, visible contributions at fundraisers, which would provide ready means for corrupting federal officeholders. Given the delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme at issue here, any associational burdens imposed by the Levin Amendment restrictions are far outweighed by the need to prevent circumvention of the entire scheme.\\n\\nSection 323(b)(2)(B)(iv)\\u2019s apparent prohibition on the transfer of hard money by a national, state, or local committee to help fund the allocable hard-money portion of a separate state or local committee\\u2019s Levin expenditures presents a closer question. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv) (Supp. II). The Government defends the restriction as necessary to prevent the donor committee, particularly a national committee, from leveraging the transfer of federal money to wrest control over the spending of the recipient committee\\u2019s Levin funds. This purported interest is weak, particularly given the fact that \\u00a7 323(a) already polices attempts by national parties to engage in such behavior. See 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(a)(2) (extending \\u00a7323(a)\\u2019s restrictions to entities controlled by national party committees). However, the associational burdens posed by the hard-money transfer restriction are so insubstantial as to be de minimis. Party committees, including national party committees, remain free to transfer *173unlimited hard money so long as it is not used to fund Levin expenditures. State and local party committees can thus dedicate all \\u201chomegrown\\u201d hard money to their Levin activities while relying on outside transfers to defray the costs of other hard-money expenditures. Given the strong anticir-cumvention interest vindicated by \\u00a7 323(b)(2)(B)(iv)\\u2019s restriction on the transfer of Levin funds, we will not strike down the entire provision based upon such an attenuated claim of associational infringement.\\n\\nc. New FECA \\u00a7323(b)\\u2019s Impact on Parties\\u2019 Ability to Engage in Effective Advocacy\\n\\nFinally, plaintiffs contend that \\u00a7 323(b) is unconstitutional because its restrictions on soft-money contributions to state and local party committees will prevent them from engaging in effective advocacy. As Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted, the political parties\\u2019 evidence regarding the impact of BCRA on their revenues is \\u201cspeculative and not based on any analysis.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 524. If the history of campaign finance regulation discussed above proves anything, it is that political parties are extraordinarily flexible in adapting to new restrictions on their fundraising abilities. Moreover, the mere fact that \\u00a7 323(b) may reduce the relative amount of money available to state and local parties to fund federal election activities is largely inconsequential. The question is not whether \\u00a7 323(b) reduces the amount of funds available over previous election cycles, but whether it is \\u201cso radical in effect as to ... drive the sound of [the recipient\\u2019s] voice below the level of notice.\\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 397. If indeed state or local parties can make such a showing, as-applied challenges remain available.\\n\\nWe accordingly conclude that \\u00a7 323(b), on its face, is closely drawn to match the important governmental interests of preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.\\n\\n*174 New FECA \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s Restrictions on Parties\\u2019 Solicitations for, and Donations to, Tax-Exempt Organizations\\n\\nSection 323(d) prohibits national, state, and local party committees, and their agents or subsidiaries, from \\u201csoliciting] any funds for, or mak[ing] or directing] any donations\\u201d to, any organization established under \\u00a7 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code66 that makes expenditures in connection with an election for federal office, and any political organizations established under \\u00a7 527 \\u201cother than a political committee, a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or the authorized campaign committee of a candidate for State or local office.\\u201d67 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d) (Supp. II). The District Court struck down the provision on its face. We reverse and uphold \\u00a7 323(d), narrowly construing the section\\u2019s ban on donations to apply only to the donation of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.\\n\\n1. New FECA \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s Regulation of Solicitations\\n\\nThe Government defends \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s ban on solicitations to tax-exempt organizations engaged in political activity as preventing circumvention of Title I\\u2019s limits on contributions of soft money to national, state, and local party committees. That justification is entirely reasonable. The history of Congress\\u2019 efforts at campaign finance reform well demonstrates that \\u201ccandidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the *175current law.\\u201d Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 457. Absent the solicitation provision, national, state, and local party committees would have significant incentives to mobilize their formidable fundraising apparatuses, including the peddling of access to federal officeholders, into the service of like-minded tax-exempt organizations that conduct activities benefiting their candidates.68 All of the corruption and appearance of corruption attendant on the operation of those fundraising apparatuses would follow. Donations made at the behest of party committees would almost certainly be regarded by party officials, donors, and federal officeholders alike as benefiting the party as well as its candidates. Yet, by soliciting the donations to third-party organizations, the parties would avoid FECA's source and amount limitations, as well as its disclosure restrictions. See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 348 (Henderson, J.) (citing various declarations demonstrating that, prior to BCRA, most tax-exempt organizations did not disclose *176the source or amount of contributions); id., at 521 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (same).\\n\\nExperience under the current law demonstrates that Congress\\u2019 concerns about circumvention are not merely hypothetical. Even without the added incentives created by Title I, national, state, and local parties already solicit unregulated soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations for the purpose of supporting federal electioneering activity. See, e. g., 3 1998 Senate Report 4013 (\\u201cIn addition to direct contributions from the RNC to nonprofit groups, the senior leadership of the RNC helped to raise funds for many of the coalition\\u2019s nonprofit organizations\\u201d); 4 id., at 5983 (minority views) (\\u201cTax-exempt \\u2018issue advocacy\\u2019 groups and other conduits were systematically used to circumvent the federal campaign finance laws\\u201d); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 517 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 848 (Leon, J.). Parties and candidates have also begun to take advantage of so-called \\u201cpolitician 527s,\\u201d which are little more than soft-money fronts for the promotion of particular federal officeholders and their interests. See id., at 519 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (\\u201c\\u2018Virtually every member of Congress in a formal leadership position has his or her own 527 group. ... In all, Public Citizen found 63 current members of Congress who have their own 527s\\u2019\\u201d (quoting Public Citizen Congress Watch, Congressional Leaders\\u2019 Soft Money Accounts Show Need for Campaign Finance Reform Bills, Feb. 26, 2002, p. 6)); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 849-850 (Leon, J.). These 527s have been quite successful at raising substantial sums of soft money from corporate interests, as well as from the national parties themselves. See id., at 519-520 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding that 27 industries had each donated over $100,000 in a single year to the top 25 politician 527 groups and that the DNC was the single largest contributor to politician 527 groups (citing Public Citizen Congress Watch, supra, at 10-11)); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 850 (Leon, J.) (same). Given BCRA\\u2019s tighter restrictions on *177the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives for parties to exploit such organizations will only increase.\\n\\nSection 323(d)\\u2019s solicitation restriction is closely drawn to prevent political parties from using tax-exempt organizations as soft-money surrogates. Though phrased as an absolute prohibition, the restriction does nothing more than subject contributions solicited by parties to FECA\\u2019s regulatory regime, leaving open substantial opportunities for solicitation and other expressive activity in support of these organizations. First, and most obviously, \\u00a7 323(d) restricts solicitations only to those \\u00a7 501(c) groups \\u201cmak[ing) expenditures or disbursements in connection with an election for Federal office,\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d)(l) (Supp. II), and to \\u00a7527 organizations, which by definition engage in partisan political activity, \\u00a7 4411(d)(2); 26 U. S. C. \\u00a7 527(e). Second, parties remain free to solicit hard-money contributions to a \\u00a7501(c)\\u2019s federal PAC, as well as to \\u00a7527 organizations that already qualify as federal PACs.69 Third, \\u00a7 323(d) allows parties to endorse qualifying organizations in ways other than direct solicitations of unregulated donations. For example, with respect to \\u00a7 501(c) organizations that are prohibited from administering PACs, parties can solicit hard-money donations to themselves for the express purpose of donating to these organizations. See infra, at 180-181. Finally, as with \\u00a7 323(a), \\u00a7 323(d) in no way restricts solicitations by party officers acting in their individual capacities. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(d) (extending restrictions to solicitations and donations *178made by \\u201can officer or agent acting on behalf of any such party committee\\u201d (emphasis added)).\\n\\nIn challenging \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s ban on solicitations, plaintiffs renew the argument they made with respect to \\u00a7 323(a)\\u2019s solicitation restrictions: that it cannot be squared with \\u00a7 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited donations of soft money to tax-exempt organizations that engage in federal election activities. Compare 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d) with \\u00a7441i(e)(4). But if \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s restrictions on solicitations are oth\\u00e9rwise valid, they are not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have. See National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210; see also Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 656-657 (1966). In any event, the difference between the two provisions is fully explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, are able to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities. Section 323(e), which is designed to accommodate the individual associational and speech interests of candidates and officeholders in lending personal support to nonprofit organizations, also places tight content, source, and amount restrictions on solicitations of soft money by federal candidates and officeholders. Given those limits, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, the greater allowances of \\u00a7 323(e) do not render \\u00a7 323(d)\\u2019s solicitation restriction facially invalid.\\n\\n2. New FECA \\u00a7823(d)\\u2019s Regulation of Donations\\n\\nSection 323(d) also prohibits national, state, and local party committees from making or directing \\u201cany donatio[n]\\u201d to qualifying \\u00a7 501(c) or \\u00a7 527 organizations. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(d) (Supp. II). The Government again defends the restriction as an anticircumvention measure. We agree insofar as it prohibits the donation of soft money. Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could *179accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectly \\u2014 namely, raising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities. Because the party itself would be raising and collecting the funds, the potential for corruption would be that much greater. We will not disturb Congress\\u2019 reasonable decision to close that loophole, particularly given a record demonstrating an already robust practice of parties making such donations. See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 517-518 (Kollar-Kotelly); id., at 848-849 (Leon, J.).\\n\\nThe prohibition does raise overbreadth concerns if read to restrict donations from a party\\u2019s federal account \\u2014 i. e., funds that have already been raised in compliance with FECA\\u2019s source, amount, and disclosure limitations. Parties have many valid reasons for giving to tax-exempt organizations, not the least of which is to associate themselves with certain causes and, in so doing, to demonstrate the values espoused by the party. A complete ban on donations prevents parties from making even the \\u201cgeneral expression of support\\u201d that a contribution represents. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 21. At the same time, prohibiting parties from donating funds already raised in compliance with FECA does little to further Congress\\u2019 goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.\\n\\nThe Government asserts that the restriction is necessary to prevent parties from leveraging their hard money to gain control over a tax-exempt group\\u2019s soft money. Even if we accepted that rationale, it would at most justify a dollar limit, not a flat ban. Moreover, any legitimate concerns over cap-time are diminished by the fact that the restrictions set forth in \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(a) and (b) apply not only to party committees, but to entities under their control. See 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(a)(2) (extending prohibitions on national party committees to \\u201cany entity that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a national committee\\u201d (em*180phasis added)); \\u00a7441i(b)(l) (same for state and local party committees).\\n\\nThese observations do not, however, require us to sustain plaintiffs\\u2019 facial challenge to \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s donation restriction. \\u201cWhen the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and ... a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932); see also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769, n. 24 (1982). Given our obligation to avoid constitutional problems, we narrowly construe \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA. This construction is consistent with the concerns animating Title I, whose purpose is to plug the soft-money loophole. Though there is little legislative history regarding BCRA generally, and almost nothing on \\u00a7 323(d) specifically, the abuses identified in the 1998 Senate Report regarding campaign finance practices involve the use of nonprofit organizations as conduits for large soft-money donations. See, e. g., 3 1998 Senate Report 4565 (\\u201cThe evidence indicates that the soft-money loophole is fueling many of the campaign abuses investigated by the Committee.... Soft money also supplied the funds parties used to make contributions to tax-exempt groups, which in turn used the funds to pay for election-related activities\\u201d); id., at 4568-4569 (describing as an \\u201cegregious examplfe]\\u201d of misuse a $4.6 million donation of nonfed-eral funds by the RNC to Americans for Tax Reform, which the organization spent on \\u201cdirect mail and phone bank operations to counter anti-Republican advertising\\u201d). We have found no evidence that Congress was concerned about, much less that it intended to prohibit, donations of money already fully regulated by FECA. Given Title I\\u2019s exclusive focus on abuses related to soft money, we would expect that if Congress meant \\u00a7323(d)\\u2019s restriction to have this dramatic and *181constitutionally questionable effect, it would say so explicitly. Because there is nothing that compels us to conclude that Congress intended \\u201cdonations\\u201d to include transfers of federal money, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, we decline to read \\u00a7 328(d) in that way. Thus, political parties remain free to make or direct donations of money to any tax-exempt organization that has otherwise, been raised in compliance with FEC A.\\n\\nNew FEC A \\u00a7323(e)\\u2019s Restrictions on Federal Candidates and Officeholders\\n\\nNew FECA \\u00a7 323(e) regulates the raising and soliciting of soft money by federal candidates and officeholders. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(e) (Supp. II). It prohibits federal candidates and officeholders from \\u201csolicit[ing], receiving], directing], transfer[ing], or spend[ing]\\u201d any soft money in connection with federal elections. \\u00a7 441i(e)(l)(A). It also limits the ability of federal candidates and officeholders to solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend soft money in connection with state and local elections. \\u00a7441i(e)(l)(B).70\\n\\nSection 323(e)\\u2019s general prohibition on solicitations admits of a number of exceptions. For instance, federal candidates and officeholders are permitted to \\u201cattend, speak, or be a featured guest\\u201d at a state or local party fundraising event. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(e)(3). Section 323(e) specifically provides *182that federal candidates and officeholders may make solicitations of soft money to \\u00a7 501(c) organizations whose primary purpose is not to engage in \\u201cFederal election activities] \\u201d as long as the solicitation does not specify how the funds will be spent, 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(e)(4)(A); to \\u00a7 501(c) organizations whose primary purpose is to engage in \\u201cFederal election activities]\\u201d as long as the solicitations are limited to individuals and the amount solicited does not exceed $20,000 per year per individual, 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 4411(e)(4)(B); and to \\u00a7 501(c) organizations for the express purpose of carrying out such activities, again so long as the amount solicited does not exceed $20,000 per year per individual, 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(e)(4)(B).\\n\\nNo party seriously questions the constitutionality of \\u00a7323(e)\\u2019s general ban on donations of soft money made directly to federal candidates and officeholders, their agents, or entities established or controlled by them. Even on the narrowest reading of Buckley, a regulation restricting donations to a federal candidate, regardless of the ends to which those funds are ultimately put, qualifies as a contribution limit subject to less rigorous scrutiny. Such donations have only marginal speech and associational value, but at the same time pose a substantial threat of corruption. By severing the most direct link between the soft-money donor and the federal candidate, \\u00a7323(e)\\u2019s ban on donations of soft money is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.\\n\\nSection 323(e)\\u2019s restrictions on solicitations are justified as valid anticireumvention measures. Large soft-money donations at a candidate\\u2019s or officeholder\\u2019s behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder. Though the candidate may not ultimately control how the funds are spent, the value of the donation to the candidate or officeholder is evident from the fact of the solicitation itself. Without some restriction on solicitations, federal candidates and officeholders could easily avoid FECA\\u2019s contribution limits by so*183liciting funds from large donors and restricted sources to like-minded organizations engaging in federal election activities. As the record demonstrates, even before the passage of BCRA, federal candidates and officeholders had already begun soliciting donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their party\\u2019s, electoral cause. See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 458 (quoting fundraising letter from a Congressman explaining to contributor that \\u201c \\u2018you are at the limit of what you can directly contribute to my campaign,\\u2019 but \\u2018you can further help my campaign by assisting the Colorado Republican Party\\u2019 \\u201d); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 479-480 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (surveying evidence of federal officeholders soliciting funds to state and local parties); id., at 848 (Leon, J.) (same); id., at 518 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (surveying evidence of federal officeholders soliciting funds for nonprofits for electioneering purposes); id., at 849 (Leon, J.) (same). The incentives to do so, at least with respect to solicitations to tax-exempt organizations, will only increase with Title I\\u2019s restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money by national, state, and local parties.\\n\\nSection 323(e) addresses these concerns while accommodating the individual speech and associational rights of federal candidates and officeholders. Rather than place an outright ban on solicitations to tax-exempt organizations, \\u00a7 323(e)(4) permits limited solicitations of soft money. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(e)(4). This allowance accommodates individuals who have long served as active members of nonprofit organizations in both their official and individual capacities. Similarly, \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(e)(1)(B) and 323(e)(3) preserve the traditional fundraising role of federal officeholders by providing limited opportunities for federal candidates and officeholders to associate with their state and local colleagues through joint fundraising activities. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441i(e)(l)(B), 441i(e)(3). Given these many exceptions, as well as the substantial threat of corruption or its appearance posed by dona*184tions to or at the behest of federal candidates and officeholders, \\u00a7 323(e) is clearly constitutional. We accordingly uphold \\u00a7 323(e) against plaintiffs\\u2019 First Amendment challenge.\\n\\nNew FECA \\u00a7323(f)\\u2019s Restrictions on State Candidates and Officeholders\\n\\nThe final provision of Title I is new FECA \\u00a7 323(f). 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441i(f) (Supp. II). Section 323(f) generally prohibits candidates for state or local office, or state or local officeholders, from spending soft money to fund \\u201cpublic communications\\u201d as defined in \\u00a7 301(20)(A)(iii) \\u2014 i. e., a communication that \\u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . .. and that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441i(f)(l); \\u00a7 431(20)(A)(iii). Exempted from this restriction are communications made in connection with an election for state or local office which refer only to the state or local candidate or officeholder making the expenditure or to any other candidate for the same state or local office. \\u00a7 441i(f)(2).\\n\\nSection 323(f) places no cap on the amount of money that state or local candidates can spend on any activity. Rather, like \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(a) and 323(b), it limits only the source and amount of contributions that state and local candidates can draw on to fund expenditures that directly impact federal elections. And, by regulating only contributions used to fund \\u201cpublic communications,\\u201d \\u00a7 323(f) focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.\\n\\nPlaintiffs advance two principal arguments against \\u00a7 323(f). We have already rejected the first argument, that the definition of \\u201cpublic communications\\u201d in new FECA \\u00a7 301(20)(A)(iii) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. See n. 64, supra. We add only that, plaintiffs\\u2019 and Justice Kennedy\\u2019s contrary reading notwithstanding, post, at 316-*185317, this provision does not prohibit a state or local candidate from advertising that he has received a federal officeholder\\u2019s endorsement.71\\n\\nThe second argument, that soft-money contributions to state and local candidates for \\u201cpublic communications\\u201d do not corrupt or appear to corrupt federal candidates, ignores both the record in this litigation and Congress\\u2019 strong interest in preventing circumvention of otherwise valid contribution limits. The proliferation of sham issue ads has driven the soft-money explosion. Parties have sought out every possible way to fund and produce these ads with soft money: They have labored to bring them under the FEC\\u2019s allocation regime; they have raised and transferred soft money from national to state party committees to take advantage of favorable allocation ratios; and they have transferred and solicited funds to tax-exempt organizations for production of such ads. We will not upset Congress\\u2019 eminently reasonable prediction that, with these other avenues no longer available, state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding of sham issue advertising. We therefore uphold \\u00a7 323(f) against plaintiffs\\u2019 First Amendment challenge.72\\n\\n*186B\\n\\nSeveral plaintiffs contend that Title I exceeds Congress\\u2019 Election Clause authority to \\u201cmake or alter\\u201d rules governing federal elections, U. S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a74, and, by impairing the authority of the States to regulate their own elections, violates constitutional principles of federalism. In examining congressional enactments for infirmity under the Tenth Amendment, this Court has focused its attention on laws that commandeer the States and state officials in carrying out federal regulatory schemes. See Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992). By contrast, Title I of BCRA only regulates the conduct of private parties. It imposes no requirements whatsoever upon States or state officials, and, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, it leaves the States free to enforce their own restrictions on the financing of state electoral campaigns. It is true that Title I, as amended, prohibits some fundraising tactics that would otherwise be permitted under the laws of various States, and that it may therefore have an indirect effect on the financing of state electoral campaigns. But these indirect effects do not render BCRA unconstitutional. It is not uncommon for federal law to prohibit private conduct that is legal in some States. See, e. g., United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buy*187ers\\u2019 Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483 (2001). Indeed, such conflict is inevitable in areas of law that involve both state and federal concerns. It is not in and of itself a marker of constitutional infirmity. See Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 392 (1880).\\n\\nOf course, in maintaining the federal system envisioned by the Founders, this Court has done more than just prevent Congress from commandeering the States. We have also policed the absolute boundaries of congressional power under Article I. See United, States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995). But plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA. Congress has a fully legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of federal officeholders and preventing corruption of federal electoral processes through the means it has chosen. Indeed, our above analysis turns on our finding that those interests are sufficient to satisfy First Amendment scrutiny. Given that finding, we cannot conclude that those interests are insufficient to ground Congress\\u2019 exercise of its Elections Clause power. See Morrison, supra, at 607 (respect owed to coordinate branches \\u201cdemands that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds\\u201d).\\n\\nC\\n\\nFinally, plaintiffs argue that Title I violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it discriminates against political parties in favor of special interest groups such as the National Rifle Association, American Civil Liberties Union, and Sierra Club. As explained earlier, BCRA imposes numerous restrictions on the fundraising abilities of political parties, of which the soft-money ban is only the most prominent. Interest groups, however, remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and *188broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications). We conclude that this disparate treatment does not offend the Constitution.\\n\\nAs an initial matter, we note that BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways. Most obviously, party committees are entitled to receive individual contributions that substantially exceed FECA\\u2019s limits on contributions to non-party political committees; individuals can give $25,000 to political party committees whereas they can give a maximum of $5,000 to nonparty political committees. In addition, party committees are entitled in effect to contribute to candidates by making coordinated expenditures, and those expenditures may greatly exceed the contribution limits that apply to other donors. See 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(d) (Supp. II).\\n\\nMore importantly, however, Congress is fully entitled to consider the real-world differences between political parties and interest groups when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation. See National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210. Interest groups do not select slates of candidates for elections. Interest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative committees, elect congressional leadership, or organize legislative caucuses. Political parties have influence and power in the Legislature that vastly exceeds that of any interest group. As a result, it is hardly surprising that party affiliation is the primary way by which voters identify candidates, or that parties in turn have special access to and relationships with federal officeholders. Congress\\u2019 efforts at campaign finance regulation may account for these salient differences. Taken seriously, plaintiffs\\u2019 equal protection arguments would call into question not just Title I of BCRA, but much of the pre-existing structure of FECA as well. We therefore reject those arguments.\\n\\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it upheld \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(e) and 323(f). We reverse the *189judgment of the District Court insofar as it invalidated \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(a), 323(b), and 323(d).\\n\\n>\\n\\nTitle II of BCRA, entitled \\u201cNoncandidate Campaign Expenditures,\\u201d is divided into two subtitles: \\u201cElectioneering Communications\\u201d and \\u201cIndependent and Coordinated Expenditures.\\u201d We consider each challenged section of these subtitles in turn.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7 201 \\u2019s Definition of \\u201cElectioneering Communications \\u201d\\n\\nThe first section of Title II, \\u00a7201, comprehensively amends FECA \\u00a7 304, which requires political committees to file detailed periodic financial reports with the FEC. The amendment coins a new term, \\u201celectioneering communications,\\u201d to replace the narrowing construction of FECA\\u2019s disclosure provisions adopted by this Court in Buckley. As discussed further below, that construction limited the coverage of FECA\\u2019s disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates. By contrast, the term \\u201celectioneering communication\\u201d is not so limited, but is defined to encompass any \\u201cbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication\\u201d that\\n\\n    \\u201c(I) refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office;\\n\\n    \\u201c(II) is made within\\u2014\\n\\n    \\u201c(aa) 60 days before a general, special, or runoff election for the office sought by the candidate; or \\u201c(bb) 30 days before a primary or preference election, or a convention or caucus of a political party that has authority to nominate a candidate, for the office sought by the candidate; and\\n\\n    \\u201c(III) in the case of a communication which refers to a candidate for an office other than President or Vice *190President, is targeted to the relevant electorate.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 434(f)(3)(A)(i) (Supp. II).73\\n\\nNew FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(3)(C) further provides that a communication is \\u201c\\u2018targeted to the relevant electorate\\u2019\\u201d if it \\u201ccan be received by 50,000 or more persons\\u201d in the district or State the candidate seeks to represent. 2 U. S. C. '\\u00a7 434(f)(3)(C).\\n\\nIn addition to setting forth this definition, BCRA\\u2019s amendments to FECA \\u00a7 304 specify significant disclosure requirements for persons who fund electioneering communications. BCRA\\u2019s use of this new term is not, however, limited to the disclosure context: A later section of the Act (BCRA \\u00a7 203, which amends FECA \\u00a7 316(b)(2)) restricts corporations\\u2019 and labor unions\\u2019 funding of electioneering communications. Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the new term as it applies in both the disclosure and the expenditure contexts.\\n\\nThe major premise of plaintiffs\\u2019, challenge to BCRA\\u2019s use of the term \\u201celectioneering communication\\u201d is that Buckley drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers possess an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech. Thus, plaintiffs maintain, Congress cannot constitutionally require disclosure of, or regulate expenditures for, \\u201celectioneering communications\\u201d without making an exception for those \\u201ccommunications\\u201d that do not meet Buckley\\u2019s definition of express advocacy.\\n\\nThat position misapprehends our prior decisions, for the express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law. In *191Buckley we began by examining then-18 U. S. C. \\u00a7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which restricted expenditures \\u201c \\u2018relative to a clearly identified candidate,\\u2019\\u201d and we found that the phrase \\u201c \\u2018relative to\\u2019 \\u201d was impermissibly vague. 424 U. S., at 40-42. We concluded that the vagueness deficiencies could \\u201cbe avoided only by reading \\u00a7 608(e)(1) as limited to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.\\u201d74 Id., at 48. We provided examples of words of express advocacy, such as \\u201c \\u2018vote for,\\u2019 \\u2018elect,\\u2019 \\u2018support,\\u2019 . . . \\u2018defeat,\\u2019 [and] \\u2018reject,\\u2019 \\u201d id., at 44, n. 52, and those examples eventually gave rise to what is now known as the \\u201cmagic words\\u201d requirement.\\n\\nWe then considered FECA\\u2019s disclosure provisions, including 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 431(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which defined \\u201c \\u2018expend\\u00edtur[e]\\u2019 \\u201d to include the use of money or other assets \\u201c \\u2018for the purpose of . . . influencing\\u2019 \\u201d a federal election. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 77. Finding that the \\u201cambiguity of this phrase\\u201d posed \\u201cconstitutional problems,\\u201d ibid., we noted our \\u201cobligation to construe the statute, if that can be done consistent with the legislature\\u2019s purpose, to avoid the shoals of vagueness,\\u201d id., at 77-78 (citations omitted). \\u201cTo insure that the reach\\u201d of the disclosure requirement was \\u201cnot im-permissibly broad, we construe[d] \\u2018expenditure\\u2019 for purposes of that section in the same way we construed the terms of \\u00a7 608(e) \\u2014 to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly id\\u00e9\\u00f1ti-fied candidate.\\u201d Id., at 80 (footnote omitted).\\n\\nThus, a plain reading of Buckley makes clear that the express advocacy limitation, in both the expenditure and the *192disclosure contexts, was the product of statutory interpretation rather than a constitutional command.75 In narrowly reading the FECA provisions in Buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth, we nowhere suggested that a statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line. Nor did we suggest as much in MCFL, 479 U. S. 238 (1986), in which we addressed the scope of another FECA expenditure limitation and confirmed the understanding that Buckley's express advocacy category was a product of statutory construction.76\\n\\nIn short, the concept of express advocacy and the concomitant class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional infirmities. See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490,500 (1979) (citing Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804)). We have long \\u201c \\u2018rigidly adhered\\u2019 \\u201d to the tenet \\u201c \\u2018never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied/ \\u201d United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (citation omitted), for \\u201c[t]he nature of judicial review constrains us to consider the case that is actually before us,\\u201d James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 547 (1991) (Blackmun, X, concurring). Consistent with that principle, our decisions in Buckley and MCFL were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the *193permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.\\n\\nNor are we persuaded, independent of our precedents, that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy. That notion cannot be squared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad. See Buckley, supra, at 45. Indeed, the unmistakable lesson from the record in this litigation, as all three judges on the District Court agreed, is that Buckley\\u2019s magic-words requirement is functionally meaningless. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 303-304 (Henderson, J.); id., at 534 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 875-879 (Leon, J.). Not only can advertisers easily evade the line by eschewing the use of magic words, but they would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted.77 And although the resulting advertisements do not urge the viewer to vote for or against a candidate in so many words, they are no less clearly intended to influence the election.78 Buckley\\u2019s *194express advocacy line, in short, has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found in the existing system.\\n\\nFinally we observe that new FECA \\u00a7304(f)(3),s definition of \\u201celectioneering communication\\u201d raises none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis in Buckley. The term \\u201celectioneering communication\\u201d applies only (1) to a broadcast (2) clearly identifying a candidate for federal office, (3) aired within a specific time period, and (4) targeted to an identified audience of at least 50,000 viewers or listeners. These components are both easily understood and objectively determinable. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-114 (1972). Thus, the constitutional objection that persuaded the Court in Buckley to limit FECA\\u2019s reach to express advocacy is simply inapposite here.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7201\\u2019s Disclosure Requirements\\n\\nHaving rejected the notion that the First Amendment requires Congress to treat so-called issue advocacy differently from express advocacy, we turn to plaintiffs\\u2019 other concerns about the use of the term \\u201celectioneering communication\\u201d in amended FECA \\u00a7304\\u2019s disclosure provisions. Under those provisions, whenever any person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 during any calendar year for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications, he must file a statement with the FEC identifying the pertinent elections and all persons sharing the costs of the disbursements. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 434(f)(2)(A), (B), and (D) (Supp. II). If the disbursements are made from a corporation\\u2019s *195or labor union\\u2019s segregated account,79 or by a single individual who has collected contributions from others, the statement must identify all persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the account or the individual during the calendar year. \\u00a7\\u00a7 434(f)(2)(E), (F). The statement must be filed within 24 hours of each \\u201cdisclosure date\\u201d \\u2014 a term defined to include the first date and all subsequent dates on which a person\\u2019s aggregate undisclosed expenses for electioneering communications exceed $10,000 for that calendar year. \\u00a7\\u00a7 434(f)(1), (2), and (4). Another subsection further provides that the execution of a contract to make a disbursement is itself treated as a disbursement for purposes of FECA\\u2019s disclosure requirements. \\u00a7 434(f)(5).\\n\\nIn addition to the failed argument that BCRA\\u2019s amendments to FECA \\u00a7 304 improperly extend to both express and issue advocacy, plaintiffs challenge amended FECA \\u00a7304\\u2019s disclosure requirements as unnecessarily (1) requiring disclosure of the names of persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the individual or group that paid for a communication, and (2) mandating disclosure of executory contracts for communications that have not yet aired. The District Court rejected the former submission but accepted the latter, finding invalid new FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(5), which governs executory contracts. Relying on BCRA\\u2019s severability provision,80 the court held that invalidation of the executory contracts subsection did *196not render the balance of BCRA\\u2019s amendments to FECA \\u00a7 304 unconstitutional. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 242 (per curiam).\\n\\nWe agree with the District Court that the important state interests that prompted the Buckley Court to uphold FECA\\u2019s disclosure requirements \\u2014 providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof, and gathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions \\u2014 apply in full to BCRA.81 Accordingly, Buckley amply supports application of FECA \\u00a7 304\\u2019s disclosure requirements to the entire range of \\u201celectioneering communications.\\u201d As the authors of the District Court\\u2019s per curiam opinion concluded after reviewing evidence concerning the use of purported \\u201cissue ads\\u201d to influence federal elections:\\n\\n    \\u201cThe factual record demonstrates that the abuse of the present law not only permits corporations and labor unions to fund broadcast advertisements designed to influence federal elections, but permits them to do so while concealing their identities from the public. BCRA\\u2019s disclosure provisions require these organizations to reveal their identities so that the public is able to identify the source of the funding behind broadcast advertisements influencing certain elections. Plaintiffs\\u2019 disdain for BCRA\\u2019s disclosure provisions is nothing short of surprising. Plaintiffs challenge BCRA\\u2019s restrictions on electioneering communications on the premise that they should be permitted to spend corporate and labor union general treasury funds in the sixty *197days before the federal elections on broadcast advertisements, which refer to federal candidates, because speech needs to be \\u2018uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\\u2019 McConnell Br. at 44 (quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964)). Curiously, Plaintiffs want to preserve the ability to run these advertisements while hiding behind dubious and misleading names like: \\u2018The Coalition-Americans Working for Real Change\\u2019 (funded by business organizations opposed to organized labor), \\u2018Citizens for Better Medicare\\u2019 (funded by the pharmaceutical industry), \\u2018Republicans for Clean Air\\u2019 (funded by brothers Charles and Sam Wyly). Findings \\u00b6\\u00b644,51,52. Given these tactics, Plaintiffs never satisfactorily answer the question of how \\u2018uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\\u2019 speech can occur when organizations hide themselves from the scrutiny of the voting public. McConnell Br. at 44. Plaintiffs\\u2019 argument for striking down BCRA\\u2019s disclosure provisions does not reinforce the precious First Amendment values that Plaintiffs argue are trampled by BCRA, but ignores the competing First Amendment interests of individual citizens seeking to make informed choices in the political marketplace.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237.\\n\\nThe District Court was also correct that Buckley forecloses a facial attack on the new provision in \\u00a7 304 that requires disclosure of the names of persons contributing $1,000 or more to segregated funds or individuals that spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications. Like our earlier decision in NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958),82 Buckley recognized *198that compelled disclosures may impose an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause. Nevertheless, Buckley rejected the contention that FECA\\u2019s disclosure requirements could not constitutionally be applied to minor parties and independent candidates because the Government\\u2019s interest in obtaining information from such parties was minimal and the danger of infringing their rights substantial. In Buckley, unlike NAACP, we found no evidence that any party had been exposed to economic reprisals or physical threats as a result of the compelled disclosures. 424 U. S., at 69-70. We acknowledged that such a case might arise in the future, however, and addressed the standard of proof that would then apply:\\n\\n    \\u201cWe recognize that unduly strict requirements of proof could impose a heavy burden, but it does not follow that a blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary. Minor parties must be allowed sufficient flexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair consideration of their claim. The evidence offered need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party\\u2019s contributors\\u2019 names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\\u201d Id., at 74.\\n\\nA few years later we used that standard to resolve a minor party\\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the State of Ohio\\u2019s disclosure requirements. We held that the First Amendment prohibits States from compelling disclosures that would subject identified persons to \\u201cthreats, harassment, and reprisals,\\u201d and that the District Court\\u2019s findings *199had established a \\u201creasonable probability\\u201d of such a result.83 Brown v. Socialist Workers \\u201974 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 100 (1982).\\n\\nIn this litigation the District Court applied Buckley\\u2019s evi-dentiary standard and found \\u2014 consistent with our conclusion in Buckley, and in contrast to that in Brown \\u2014 that the evidence did not establish the requisite \\u201creasonable probability\\u201d of harm to any plaintiff group or its members. The District Court noted that some parties had expressed such concerns, but it found a \\u201clack of specific evidence about the basis for these concerns.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 247 (per curiam). We agree, but we note that, like our refusal to recognize a blanket exception for minor parties in Buckley, our rejection of plaintiffs\\u2019 facial challenge to the requirement to disclose individual donors does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that requirement.\\n\\nWe also are unpersuaded by plaintiffs\\u2019 challenge to new FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(5), which requires disclosure of executory contracts for electioneering communications:\\n\\n    *200\\u201cContracts to disburse\\n\\n    \\u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a person shall be treated as having made a disbursement if the person has executed a contract to make the disbursement.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 434(f)(5) (Supp. II).\\n\\nIn our view, this provision serves an important purpose the District Court did not advance. BCRA\\u2019s amendments to FECA \\u00a7304 mandate disclosure only if and when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications. Plaintiffs do not take issue with the use of a dollar amount, rather than the number or dates of the ads, to identify the time when a person paying for electioneering communications must make disclosures to the FEC. Nor do they question the need to make the contents of parties\\u2019 disclosure statements available to curious voters in advance of elections. Given the relatively short timeframes in which electioneering communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made promptly and in time to provide relevant information to voters is unquestionably significant. Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole if advertisers were not required to disclose executory contracts. In the absence of that requirement, political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures concerning ads slated to run during the final week of a campaign simply by making a preelection down-payment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election. Indeed, if the advertiser waited to pay that balance until the next calendar year then, as long as the balance did not itself exceed $10,000, the advertiser might avoid the disclosure requirements completely.\\n\\nThe record contains little evidence identifying any harm that might flow from the enforcement of \\u00a7304(f)(5)\\u2019s \\u201cadvance\\u201d disclosure requirement. The District Court speculated that disclosing information about contracts \\u201cthat have *201not been performed, and may never be performed, may lead to confusion and an unclear record upon which the public will evaluate the forces operating in the political marketplace.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 241 (per curiam). Without evidence relating to the frequency of nonperformance of executed contracts, such speculation cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place. It is ho doubt true that \\u00a7 304(f)(5) will sometimes require the filing of disclosure statements in advance of the actual broadcast of an advertisement.84 But the same would be true in the absence of an advance disclosure requirement, if a television station insisted on advance payment for all of the ads covered by a contract. Thus, the possibility that amended \\u00a7304 may sometimes require disclosures prior to the airing of an ad is as much a function of the use of disbursements (rather than the date of an ad) to trigger the disclosure requirement as it is a function of \\u00a7 304(f)(5)\\u2019s treatment of executory contracts.\\n\\nAs the District Court observed, amended FECA \\u00a7304\\u2019s disclosure requirements are constitutional because they \\u2018\\u201cd[o] not prevent anyone from speaking.\\u2019\\u201d Ibid, (quoting Brief for FEC in Opposition in No. 02-582 et al. (DC), p. 112). Moreover, the required disclosures \\u201c\\u2018would not have to reveal the specific content of the advertisements, yet they would perform an important function in informing the public about various candidates\\u2019 supporters before election day.\\u2019\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 241 (quoting Brief for FEC in Opposition, supra, at 112) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it upheld the disclosure requirements in amended FECA \\u00a7304 and rejected the facial attack on the provisions relating to donors *202of $1,000 or more, and reverse that judgment insofar as it invalidated FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(5).\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7 202\\u2019s Treatment of \\u201cCoordinated Communications\\u201d as Contributions\\n\\nSection 202 of BCRA amends FECA \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for \\u201celectioneering communication[s]\\u201d that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(a)(7)(C) (Supp. II).85 The amendment clarifies the scope of the preceding subsection, \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B), which states more generally that \\u201cexpenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of\\u201d a candidate or party will constitute contributions. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441a(a)(7)(B)(i)-(ii) (2000 ed. and Supp. II). In Buckley we construed the statutory term \\u201cexpenditure\\u201d to reach only spending for express advocacy. 424 U. S., at 40-44, and n. 52 (addressing 18 U. S. C. \\u00a7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which placed a $1,000 cap on expenditures \\u201c/relative to a clearly identified candidate\\u2019\\u201d)., BCRA \\u00a7202 pre-empts a possible claim that \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B) is similarly limited, such that coordinated expenditures for communications that avoid express advocacy cannot be counted as contributions. As we ex*203plained above, see supra, at 190-193, Buckley's narrow interpretation of the term \\u201cexpenditure\\u201d was not a constitutional limitation on Congress\\u2019 power to regulate federal elections. Accordingly, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats all other coordinated expenditures. We affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it held that plaintiffs had advanced \\u201cno basis for finding Section 202 unconstitutional.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 250.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7203\\u2019s Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements for Electioneering Communications\\n\\nSince our decision in Buckley, Congress\\u2019 power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law. The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds authorized by FECA \\u00a7316, 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441b (2000 ed. and Supp. II), has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been this Court\\u2019s unanimous view,86 and it is not challenged in this litigation.\\n\\n*204Section 203 of BCRA amends FECA \\u00a7 316(b)(2) to extend this rule, which previously applied only to express advocacy, to all \\u201celectioneering communications\\u201d covered by the definition of that term in amended FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(3), discussed above. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441b(b)(2) (Supp. II).87 Thus, under BCRA, corporations and unions may not use their general treasury funds to finance electioneering communications, but they remain free to organize and administer segregated funds, or PACs, for that purpose. Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is \\u201csimply wrong\\u201d to view the provision as a \\u201ccomplete ban\\u201d on expression rather than a regulation. Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 162. As we explained in Beaumont:\\n\\n    \\u201cThe PAC option allows corporate political participation without the temptation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members, and it lets the government regulate campaign activity through registration and disclosure, see [2 U. S. C.] \\u00a7\\u00a7 432-434, without jeopardizing the associational rights of advocacy organizations\\u2019 members.\\u201d Id., at 163 (citation omitted).\\n\\nSee also Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 658 (1990).\\n\\nRather than arguing that the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds is a complete ban that operates as a prior restraint, plaintiffs instead challenge the expanded regulation on the grounds that it is both overbroad and underinclu-sive. Our consideration of plaintiffs\\u2019 challenge is informed by our earlier conclusion that the distinction between ex*205press advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled. In that light, we must examine the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluate whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden. Id., at 657. The latter question \\u2014 . whether the state interest is compelling \\u2014 is easily answered by our prior decisions regarding campaign finance regulation, which \\u201crepresent respect for the \\u2018legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation.\\u2019\\u201d Beaumont, supra, at 155 (quoting National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 209-210). We have repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at \\u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\\u2019s support for the corporation\\u2019s political ideas.\\u201d Austin, supra, at 660; see Beaumont, supra, at 154-155; National Right to Work, supra, at 209-210. Moreover, recent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against \\u201c\\u2018circumvention of [valid] contribution limits.\\u2019\\u201d Beaumont, supra, at 155 (quoting Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 456, and n. 18.)\\n\\nIn light of our precedents, plaintiffs do not contest that the Government has a compelling interest in regulating advertisements that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office. Nor do they contend that the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy. After all, \\u201cthe constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,\\u201d Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971), and \\u201c[a]dvocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation,\\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48. Rather, plaintiffs argue that *206the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.\\n\\nThis argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters\\u2019 decisions and have that effect. The precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were, aired during those relatively brief preelection timespans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the District Court. See 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307-312 (Henderson, J.); id,., at 583-587 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 796-798 (Leon, J.). Nevertheless, the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose. Annenberg Report 13-14; App. 1330-1348 (Krasno & Sorauf Expert Report); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 573-578 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 826-827 (Leon, J.). Moreover, whatever the precise percentage may have been in the past, in the.future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads during those timeframes by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.88\\n\\n*207We are therefore not persuaded that plaintiffs have carried their heavy burden of proving that amended FECA \\u00a7 316(b)(2) is overbroad. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 613 (1973). Even if we assumed that BCRA will inhibit some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech, that assumption would not \\u201cjustify prohibiting all enforcement\\u201d of the law unless its application to protected speech is substantial, \\u201cnot only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the scope of the law\\u2019s plainly legitimate applications.\\u201d Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 120 (2003). Far from establishing that BCRA\\u2019s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.\\n\\nPlaintiffs also argue that FECA \\u00a7316(b)(2)\\u2019s segregated-fund requirement for electioneering communications is un-derinclusive because it does not apply to advertising in the print media or on the Internet. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 434(f) (3)(A) (Supp. II). The records developed in this litigation and by the Senate Committee adequately explain the reasons for this legislative choice. Congress found that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the periods immediately preceding federal elections, and that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569-573 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 799 (Leon, J.); 3 1998 Senate Report 4465, 4474-4481; 5 id., at 7521-7525. As we held in Buckley, \\u201creform may take one step at a time, *208addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 106 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). One might just as well argue that the electioneering communication definition is underinclusive because it leaves advertising 61 days in advance of an election entirely unregulated. The record amply justifies Congress\\u2019 line-drawing.\\n\\nIn addition to arguing that \\u00a7316(b)(2)\\u2019s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive, some plaintiffs contend that it unconstitutionally discriminates in favor of media companies. FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(3)(B)(i) excludes from the definition of electioneering communications any \\u201ccommunication appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7434(f)(3)(B)(i) (Supp. II). Plaintiffs argue this provision gives free rein to media companies to engage in speech without resort to PAC money. Section 304(f)(3)(B)(i)\\u2019s effect, however, is much narrower than plaintiffs suggest. The provision excepts news items and commentary only; it does not afford carte blanche to media companies generally to ignore FECA\\u2019s provisions. The statute\\u2019s narrow exception is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles. \\u201cA valid distinction ... exists between corporations that are part of the media industry and other corporations that are not involved in the regular business of imparting news to the public.\\u201d Austin, 494 U. S., at 668. Numerous federal statutes have drawn this distinction to ensure that the law \\u201cdoes not hinder or prevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing editorials about, newsworthy events.\\u201d Ibid, (citations omitted); see, e. g., 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(9)(B)(i) (exempting news stories, commentaries, and editorials from FECA\\u2019s definition of \\u201cexpenditure\\u201d); 15 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1801-1804 (providing a limited antitrust exemption for newspapers); 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a) (excepting newscasts, news *209interviews, and news documentaries from the requirement that broadcasters provide equal time to candidates for public office).89\\n\\nWe affirm the District Court\\u2019s judgment to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of FECA \\u00a7 316(b)(2); to the extent that it invalidated any part of \\u00a7 316(b)(2), we reverse the judgment.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7204\\u2019s Application to Nonprofit Corporations\\n\\nSection 204 of BCRA, which adds FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(6), applies the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications to not-for-profit corporations.90 Prior to the enactment of BCRA, FECA re*210quired such corporations, like business corporations, to pay for their express advocacy. from segregated funds rather than from their general treasuries. Our recent decision in Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003), confirmed that the requirement was valid except insofar as it applied to a subcategory of corporations described as \\u201cMCFL organizations,\\u201d as defined by our decision in MCFL, 479 U. S. 238 (1986).91 The constitutional objection to applying FECA\\u2019s segregated-fund requirement to so-called MCFL organizations necessarily applies with equal force to FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(6).\\n\\nOur decision in MCFL related to a carefully defined category of entities. We identified three features of the organization at issue in that case that were central to our holding:\\n\\n    \\u201cFirst, it was formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and cannot engage in business activities. If political fundraising events are expressly denominated as requests for contributions that will be used for political purposes, including direct expenditures, these events cannot be considered business activities. This ensures that political resources reflect political support. Second, it has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on its assets or earnings. This ensures that persons connected with *211the organization will have no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity. Third, MCFL was not established by a business corporation or a labor union, and it is its policy not to accept contributions from such entities. This prevents such corporations from serving as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\\u201d Id,, at 264.\\n\\nThat FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt MCFL organizations from its prohibition is not a sufficient reason to invalidate the entire section. If a reasonable limiting construction \\u201chas been or could be placed on the challenged statute\\u201d to avoid constitutional concerns, we should embrace it. Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 613; Buckley, 424 U. S., at 44. Because our decision in the MCFL case was on the books for many years before BCRA was enacted, we presume that the legislators who drafted \\u00a7 316(c)(6) were fully aware that the provision could not validly apply to MCFL-type entities. See Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 896 (1988); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-697 (1979). Indeed, the Government itself concedes that \\u00a7 316(c)(6) does not apply to MCFL organizations. As so construed, the provision is plainly valid. See Austin, 494 U. S., at 661-665 (holding that a segregated-fund requirement that did not explicitly carve out an MCFL exception could apply to a nonprofit corporation that did not qualify for MCFL status).\\n\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the District Court upholding \\u00a7 316(c)(6) as so limited is affirmed.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7212\\u2019s Reporting Requirement for $1,000 Expenditures\\n\\nSection 212 of BCRA amends FECA \\u00a7304 to add a new disclosure requirement, FECA \\u00a7 304(g), which applies to persons making independent expenditures of $1,000 or more during the 20-day period immediately preceding an election. *212Like FECA \\u00a7 304(f)(5), discussed above, new \\u00a7 304(g) treats the execution of a contract to make a disbursement as the functional equivalent of a payment for the goods or services covered by the contract.92 In challenging this provision, plaintiffs renew the argument we rejected in the context of \\u00a7 304(f)(5): that they have a constitutional right to postpone any disclosure until after the performance of the services purchased by their expenditure.\\n\\nThe District Court held that the challenge to FECA \\u00a7 304(g) was not ripe because the FEC has issued regulations \\u201cproviding] Plaintiffs with the exact remedy they seek\\u201d\\u2014 that is, specifically declining to \\u201crequire disclosure of independent express advocacy expenditures prior to their \\u2018pub-life] dissemination].\\u2019 \\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 251, and n. 85 (per curiam) (citing 68 Fed. Reg. 404, 452 (2003) (codified at 11 CFR \\u00a7\\u00a7 109.10(c), (d) (2003))). We are not certain that a regulation purporting to limit the range of circumstances in which a speech-burdening statute will be enforced can render nonjusticiable a facial challenge to the (concededly broader) underlying statute. Nevertheless, we need not separately address the constitutionality of \\u00a7 304(g), for our ruling as to BCRA \\u00a7201, see supra, at 194-202, renders the issue essentially moot.\\n\\n*213 BCR A \\u00a7213,s Requirement that Political Parties Choose Between Coordinated and Independent Expenditures After Nominating a Candidate\\n\\nSection 213 of BCRA amends FECA \\u00a7 315(d)(4) to impose certain limits on party spending during the postnomination, preelection period.93 At first blush, the text of \\u00a7 315(d)(4)(A) appears to require political parties to make a straightforward choice between using limited coordinated expenditures or unlimited independent expenditures to support their nominees. All three judges on the District Court concluded that the provision placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties\\u2019 right to make unlimited independent expenditures. *214251 F. Supp. 2d, at 388 (Henderson, J.); id., at 650-651 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.), id., at 805-808 (Leon, J.). In the end, we agree with that conclusion but believe it important to identify certain complexities in the text of \\u00a7 315(d)(4) that affect our analysis of the issue.\\n\\nSection 315 of FECA sets forth various limitations on contributions and expenditures by individuals, political parties, and other groups. Section 315(a)(2) restricts \\u201ccontributions\\u201d by parties to $5,000 per candidate. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441a(a)(2). Because \\u00a7 315(a)(7) treats expenditures that are coordinated with a candidate as contributions to that candidate, 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(a)(7) (2000 ed. and Supp. II), the $5,000 limit also operates as a cap on parties\\u2019 coordinated expenditures. Section 315(d), however, provides that, \\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law with respect to limitations on expenditures or limitations on contributions,\\u201d political parties may make \\u201cexpenditures\\u201d in support of their candidates under a formula keyed to the voting-age population of the candidate\\u2019s home State or, in the case of a candidate for President, the voting-age population of the United States. 2 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7441a(d)-(3) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).94 In *215the year 2000, that formula permitted expenditures ranging from $33,780 to $67,650 for House of Representatives races, and from $67,650 to $1.6 million for Senate races. Colorado 11, 533 U. S., at 439, n. 3. We held in Colorado I that parties have a constitutional right to make unlimited independent expenditures, and we invalidated \\u00a7 315(d) to the extent that it restricted such expenditures. As a result of that decision, \\u00a7 315(d) applies only to coordinated expenditures, replacing the $5,000 cap on contributions set out in \\u00a7 315(a)(2) with .the more generous limitations prescribed by \\u00a7\\u00a7 315(d)(1) \\u2014 (3). We sustained that limited application in Colorado II, supra.\\n\\nSection 213 of BCRA amends \\u00a7 315(d) by adding a new paragraph (4). New \\u00a7 315(d)(4)(A) provides that, after a party nominates a candidate for federal office, it must choose between two spending options. Under the first option, a party that \\u201cmakes any independent expenditure (as defined in section [301(17)])\\u201d is thereby barred from making \\u201cany coordinated expenditure under this subsection.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(d)(4)(A)(i) (Supp. II). The phrase \\u201cthis subsection\\u201d is a reference to subsection (d) of \\u00a7 315. Thus, the consequence of making an independent expenditure is not a complete prohibition of any coordinated expenditure: Although the party cannot take advantage of the increased spending limits under \\u00a7\\u00a7 315(d)(1) \\u2014 (B), it still may make up to $5,000 in coordinated expenditures under \\u00a7 315(a)(2). As the difference between $5,000 and $1.6 million demonstrates, *216however, that is a significant cost to impose on the exercise of a constitutional right.\\n\\nThe second option is the converse of the first. It provides that a party that makes any coordinated expenditure \\u201cunder this subsection\\u201d (i e., one that exceeds the ordinary $5,000 limit) cannot make \\u201cany independent expenditure (as defined in section [301(17)]) with respect to the candidate.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(d)(4)(A)(ii). Section 301(17) defines \\u201c\\u2018independent expenditure\\u2019\\u201d to mean a noncoordinated expenditure \\u201cexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(17)(A).95 Therefore, as was true of the first option, the party\\u2019s choice is not as stark as it initially appears: The consequence of the larger coordinated expenditure is not a complete prohibition of any independent expenditure, but the forfeiture of the right to make independent expenditures for express advocacy.. As we explained in our discussion of the provisions relating to. electioneering communications, supra, at 189-194, express advocacy represents only a tiny fraction of the political communications made for the purpose of electing or defeating candidates during a campaign. Regardless of which option parties choose, they remain free to make independent ex*217penditures for the vast majority of campaign ads that avoid the use of a few magic words.\\n\\nIn sum, the coverage of new FECA \\u00a7 315(d)(4) is much more limited than it initially appears. A party that wishes to spend more than $5,000 in coordination with its nominee is forced to forgo only the narrow category of independent expenditures that make use of magic words. But while the category of burdened speech is relatively small, it plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 44-45, 48. Under \\u00a7 315(d)(4), a political party\\u2019s exercise of its constitutionally protected right to engage in \\u201ccore First Amendment expression,\\u201d id., at 48, results in the loss of a valuable statutory benefit that has been available to parties for many years. To survive constitutional scrutiny, a provision that has such consequences must be supported by a meaningful governmental interest.\\n\\nThe interest in requiring political parties to avoid the use of magic words is not such an interest. We held in Buckley that a $1,000 cap on expenditures that applied only to express advocacy could not be justified as a means of avoiding circumvention of contribution limits or preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption because its restrictions could easily be evaded: \\u201cSo long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.\\u201d Id., at 45. The same is true in this litigation. Any claim that a restriction on independent express advocacy serves a strong Government interest is belied by the overwhelming evidence that the line between express advocacy and other types of election-influencing expression is, for Congress\\u2019 purposes, functionally meaningless. Indeed, Congress enacted the new \\u201celectioneering communication[s]\\u201d provisions precisely because it recognized that the express advocacy test was woefully inadequate at capturing communications designed to influence candidate elections. In light of that recognition, we are hard pressed to conclude that any *218meaningful purpose is served by \\u00a7315(d)(4)\\u2019s burden on a party\\u2019s right to engage independently in express advocacy.\\n\\nThe Government argues that \\u00a7 315(d)(4) nevertheless is constitutional because it is not an outright ban (or cap) on independent expenditures, but rather offers parties a voluntary choice between a constitutional right and a statutory benefit. Whatever merit that argument might have in the abstract, it fails to account for new \\u00a7 315(d)(4)(B), which provides:\\n\\n    \\u201cFor purposes of this paragraph, all political committees established and maintained by a national political party (including all congressional campaign committees) and all political committees established and maintained by a State political party (including any subordinate committee of a State committee) shall be considered to be a single political committee.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441a(d)(4)(B) (Supp. II).\\n\\nGiven that provision, it simply is not the case that each party committee can make a voluntary and independent choice between exercising its right to engage in independent advocacy and taking advantage of the increased limits on coordinated spending under \\u00a7\\u00a7 315(d)(1) \\u2014 (3). Instead, the decision resides solely in the hands of the first mover, such that a local party committee can bind both the state and national parties to its chosen spending option.96 It is one thing to say that Congress may require a party committee to give *219up its right to make independent expenditures if it believes that it can accomplish more with coordinated expenditures. It is quite another thing, however, to say that the RNC must limit itself to $5,000 in coordinated expenditures in support of its Presidential nominee if any state or local committee first makes an independent expenditure for an ad that uses magic words. That odd result undermines any claim that new \\u00a7 315(d)(4) can withstand constitutional scrutiny simply because it is cast as a voluntary choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures.\\n\\nThe portion of the judgment of the District Court invalidating BCRA \\u00a7 213 is affirmed.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a72U\\u2019s Changes in FECA\\u2019s Provisions Covering Coordinated Expenditures\\n\\nEver since our decision in Buckley, it has been settled that expenditures by a noncandidate that are \\u201ccontrolled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign\\u201d may be treated as indirect contributions subject to FECA\\u2019s source and amount limitations. 424 U. S., at 46. Thus, FECA \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B)(i) long has provided that \\u201cexpenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to such candidate.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(a) (7)(B)(i). Section 214(a) of BCRA creates a new FECA \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) that applies the same rule to expenditures coordinated with \\u201ca national, State, or local committee of a political party.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(a)(7)(B)(ii) (Supp. II).97 Sections 214(b) and (c) direct the FEC to repeal *220its current regulations98 and to promulgate new regulations dealing with \\u201ccoordinated communications\\u201d paid for by persons other than candidates or their parties. Subsection (c) provides that the new \\u201cregulations shall not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination.\\u201d Note following 2 U. S.'C. \\u00a7441a(a) (Supp. II).\\n\\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that Congress may apply the same coordination rules to parties as to candidates. They argue instead that new FECA \\u00a7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) and its implementing regulations are overbroad and unconstitutionally vague because they permit a finding of coordination even in the absence of an agreement. Plaintiffs point out that political supporters may be subjected to criminal liability if they exceed the contribution limits with expenditures that ultimately are deemed coordinated. Thus, they stress the importance of a clear definition of \\u201ccoordination\\u201d and argue any definition that does not hinge on the presence of an agreement cannot provide the \\u201cprecise guidance\\u201d that the First Amendment demands. Brief for Appellant Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al. in No. 02-1756, p. 48. As plaintiffs readily admit, that argument reaches beyond BCRA, calling into question FECA\\u2019s pre-existing provisions governing expenditures coordinated with candidates.\\n\\n*221We are not persuaded that the presence of an agreement marks the dividing line between expenditures that are coordinated \\u2014 and therefore may be regulated as indirect contributions \\u2014 and expenditures that truly are independent. We repeatedly have struck down limitations on expenditures \\u201cmade totally independently of the candidate and his campaign,\\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47, on the ground that such limitations \\u201cimpose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association\\u201d than do limits on contributions and coordinated expenditures, id., at 44, while \\u201cfailing] to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\\u201d id., at 47-48. See also Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 613-614 (striking down limit on expenditure made by party officials prior to nomination of candidates and without any consultation, with potential nominees). We explained in Buckley:\\n\\n    \\u201cUnlike contributions, . . . independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate\\u2019s campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 47.\\n\\nThus, the rationale for affording special protection to wholly independent expenditures has nothing to do with the absence of an agreement and everything to do with the functional consequences of different types of expenditures. Independent expenditures \\u201care poor sources of leverage for a spender because they might be duplicative or counterproductive from a candidate\\u2019s point of view.\\u201d Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 446. By contrast, expenditures made after a \\u201cwink or nod\\u201d often will be \\u201cas useful to the candidate as cash.\\u201d Id., at 442, 446. For that reason, Congress has always *222treated expenditures made \\u201cat the request or suggestion of\\u201d a. candidate as coordinated.99 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). A supporter easily could comply with a candidate\\u2019s request or suggestion without first agreeing to do so, and the resulting expenditure would be \\u2018\\u201cvirtually indistinguishable from [a] simple contribution],\\u2019\\u201d Colorado II, supra, at 444-445. Therefore, we cannot agree with the submission that new FECA \\u00a7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is overbroad because it permits a finding of coordination or cooperation notwithstanding the absence of a pre-existing agreement.\\n\\nNor are we persuaded that the absence of an agreement requirement renders \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague. An agreement has never been required to support a finding of coordination with a candidate under \\u00a7 315(a)(7) (B)(i), which refers to expenditures made \\u201cin cooperation, consultation, or concer[t] with, or at the request or suggestion of\\u201d a candidate. Congress used precisely the same language in new \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) to address expenditures coordinated with parties. FECA\\u2019s longstanding definition of coordination \\u201cdelineates its reach in words of common understanding.\\u201d Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U. S. 611, 616 (1968). Not surprisingly, therefore, the relevant statutory language has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades. Although that fact does not insulate the definition from constitutional scrutiny, it does undermine plaintiffs\\u2019 claim that the language of \\u00a7 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is intolerably vague. Plaintiffs do not present any evidence that *223the definition has chilled political speech, whether between candidates and their supporters or by the supporters to the general public. See Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997) (noting risk that vague statutes may chill protected expression). And, although plaintiffs speculate that the FEC could engage in intrusive and politically motivated investigations into alleged coordination, they do not even attempt to explain why an agreement requirement would solve that problem. Moreover, the only evidence plaintiffs have adduced regarding the enforcement of the coordination provision during its 27-year history concerns three investigations in the late 1990\\u2019s into groups on different sides of the political aisle. Such meager evidence does not support the claim that \\u00a7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) will \\u201cfoster \\u2018arbitrary and discriminatory application.\\u2019\\u201d Buckley, supra, at 41, n. 48 (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S., at 108-109). We conclude that FECA\\u2019s definition of coordination gives \\u201cfair notice to those to whom [it] is directed,\\u201d American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 412 (1950), and is not unconstitutionally vague.\\n\\nFinally, portions of plaintiffs\\u2019 challenge to BCRA \\u00a7214 focus on the regulations the FEC has promulgated under \\u00a7 214(c). 11 CFR \\u00a7 109.21 (2003). As the District Court explained, issues concerning the regulations are not appropriately raised in this facial challenge to BCRA, but must be pursued in a separate proceeding. Thus, we agree with the District Court that plaintiffs\\u2019 challenge to \\u00a7\\u00a7 214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that the alleged constitutional infirmities are found in the implementing regulations rather than the statute itself.\\n\\nThe portions of the District Court judgment rejecting plaintiffs\\u2019 challenges to BCRA \\u00a7214 are affirmed.\\n\\nV\\n\\nMany years ago we observed that \\u201c[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safe*224guard ... an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S., at 545. We abide by that conviction in considering Congress\\u2019 most recent effort to confine the ill effects of aggregated wealth on our political system. We are under no illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional statement on the matter. Money, like water, will always find an outlet. What problems will arise, and how Congress will respond, are concerns for another day. In the main we uphold BCRA\\u2019s two principal, complementary features: the control of soft money and the regulation of electioneering communications. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the District Court's judgment with respect to Titles I and II.\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Titles III and IV.*\\n\\nThis opinion addresses issues involving miscellaneous Title III and IV provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 81. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court with respect to these provisions.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7305\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7305 amends the federal Communications Act of 1934 (Communications Act) \\u00a7 315(b), 48 Stat. 1088, as amended, 86 Stat. 4, which requires that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, broadcast stations must sell a qualified candidate the \\u201clowest unit charge *225of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period,\\u201d 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(b)(1). Section 305\\u2019s amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that lowest unit charge unless the candidate \\u201cprovides written certification to the broadcast station that the candidate (and any authorized committee of the candidate) shall not make any direct reference to another candidate for the same office,\\u201d or the candidate, in the manner prescribed in BCRA \\u00a7 305(a)(3), clearly identifies herself at the end of the broadcast and states that she approves of the broadcast. 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 315(b)(2)(A), (C) (Supp. II).\\n\\nThe McConnell plaintiffs challenge \\u00a7305. They argue that Senator McConnell\\u2019s testimony that he plans to run advertisements critical of his opponents in the future and that he had run them in the past is sufficient to establish standing. We think not.\\n\\nArticle III of the Constitution limits the \\u201cjudicial power\\u201d to the resolution of \\u201ccases\\u201d and \\u201ccontroversies.\\u201d One element of the \\u201cbedrock\\u201d case-or-controversy requirement is that plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997). On many occasions, we have reiterated the three requirements that constitute the \\u201c\\u2018irreducible constitutional minimum\\u2019\\u201d of standing. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 771 (2000). First, a plaintiff must demonstrate an \\\"injury in fact,\\u201d which is \\u201cconcrete,\\u201d \\\"distinct and palpable,\\u201d and \\u201cactual or imminent.\\u201d Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149,155 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Second, a plaintiff must establish \\u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \\u2014 the injury has to be \\u2018fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] some third party not before the court.\\u2019\\u201d Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992) (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976)). Third, a plaintiff must show the *226\\u201c \\u2018substantial likelihood\\u2019 that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.\\u201d Stevens, supra, at 771.\\n\\nAs noted above, \\u00a7 305 amended the Communications Act\\u2019s requirements with respect to the lowest unit charge for broadcasting time. But this price is not available to qualified candidates until 45 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election. Because Senator McConnell\\u2019s current term does not expire until 2009, the earliest day he could be affected by \\u00a7 305 is 45 days before the Republican primary election in 2008. This alleged injury in fact is too remote temporally to satisfy Article III standing. See Whitmore, supra, at 158 (\\u201cA threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact\\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983) (A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show he is \\u201c \\u2018immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury\\u2019 as [a] result\\u201d of the challenged conduct). Because we hold that the McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge \\u00a7305, we affirm the District Court\\u2019s dismissal of the challenge to BCRA \\u00a7 305.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7307\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7307, which amends \\u00a7 315(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as added, 90 Stat. 487, increases and indexes for inflation certain FECA contribution limits. The Adams and Paul plaintiffs challenge \\u00a7307 in this Court. Both groups contend that they have standing to sue. Again, we disagree.\\n\\nThe Adams plaintiffs, a group consisting of voters, organizations representing voters, and candidates, allege two injuries, and argue each is legally cognizable, \\u201cas established by case law outlawing electoral discrimination based on economic status ... and upholding the right to an equally meaningful vote . . . .\\u201d Brief for Appellant Adams et al. in No. 02-1740, p. 31.\\n\\n*227First, they assert that the increases in hard-money limits enacted by \\u00a7307 deprive them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status. But, to satisfy our standing requirements, a plaintiff\\u2019s alleged injury must be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest. Lujan, supra, at 560. We have noted that \\u201c[although standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff\\u2019s contention that particular conduct is illegal,... it often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500 (1975) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have never recognized a legal right comparable to the broad and diffuse injury asserted by the Adams plaintiffs. Their reliance on this Court\\u2019s voting rights cases is misplaced. They rely on cases requiring nondiscriminatory access to the ballot and a single, equal vote for each voter. See, e.g., Lubin v. Panish, 415 U. S. 709 (1974) (invalidating a statute requiring a ballot-access fee fixed at a percentage of the salary for the office sought because it unconstitutionally burdened the right to vote); Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 666-668 (1966) (invalidating a state poll tax because it effectively denied the right to vote).\\n\\nNone of these plaintiffs claims a denial of equal access to the ballot or the right to vote. Instead, the plaintiffs allege a curtailment of the scope of their participation in the electoral process. But we have noted that \\u201c [political \\u2018free trade\\u2019 does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources.\\u201d Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238,257 (1986); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 48 (1976) (per curiam) (rejecting the asserted government interest of \\u201cequalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\\u201d to justify the burden on speech presented by expenditure limits). This claim of injury by the Adams plaintiffs is, therefore, not to a legally cognizable right.\\n\\n*228Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates contend that they have suffered a competitive injury. Their candidates \\u201cdo not wish to solicit or accept large campaign contributions as permitted by BCRA\\u201d because \\u2018Whey believe such contributions create the appearance of unequal access and influence.\\u201d Adams Complaint \\u00b6 53. As a result, they claim that BCRA \\u00a7307 puts them at a \\u201cfundraising disadvantage,\\u201d making it more difficult for them to compete in elections. See id., \\u00b6 56.\\n\\nThe second claimed injury is based on the same premise as the first: BCRA \\u00a7 307\\u2019s increased hard-money limits allow plaintiffs-candidates\\u2019 opponents to raise more money, and, consequently, the plaintiffs-candidates\\u2019 ability to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished. But they cannot show that their alleged injury is \\u201cfairly traceable\\u201d to BCRA \\u00a7307. See Lujan, 504 U. S. at 562. Their alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of \\u00a7307, but from their own personal \\u201cwish\\u201d not to solicit or accept large contributions, i.e., their personal choice. Accordingly, the Adams plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is \\u201cfairly traceable\\u201d to BCRA.\\n\\nThe Paul plaintiffs maintain that BCRA \\u00a7 307 violates the Freedom of Press Clause of the First Amendment. They contend that their political campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities and that, therefore, they are protected by the First Amendment\\u2019s guarantee of the freedom of press. The Paul plaintiffs argue that the contribution limits imposed by BCRA \\u00a7307, together with the individual and political action committee contribution limitations of FECA \\u00a7315, impose unconstitutional editorial control upon candidates and their campaigns. The Paul plaintiffs argue that by imposing economic burdens upon them, but not upon the institutional media, see 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 431(9)(B)(i) (exempting \\u201cany news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled *229by any political party, political committee, or candidate\\u201d from the definition of expenditure), BCRA \\u00a7 307 and FECA \\u00a7 315 violate the freedom of the press.\\n\\nThe Paul plaintiffs cannot show the \\u2018\\u201csubstantial likelihood\\u2019 that the requested relief will remedy [their] alleged injury in fact,\\u201d Stevens, 529 U. S., at 771. The relief the Paul plaintiffs seek is for this Court to strike down the contribution limits, removing the alleged disparate editorial controls and economic burdens imposed on them. But \\u00a7307 merely increased and indexed for inflation certain FECA contribution limits. This Court has no power to adjudicate a challenge to the FECA limits in this litigation because challenges to the constitutionality of FECA provisions are subject to direct review before an appropriate en banc court of appeals, as provided in 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 437h, not in the three-judge District Court convened pursuant to BCRA \\u00a7 403(a). Although the Court has jurisdiction to hear a challenge to \\u00a7307, if the Court were to strike down the increases and indexes established by BCRA \\u00a7 307, it would not remedy the Paul plaintiffs\\u2019 alleged injury because both the limitations imposed by FECA and the exemption for news media would remain unchanged. A ruling in the Paul plaintiffs\\u2019 favor, therefore, would not redress their alleged injury, and they accordingly lack standing. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83,105-110 (1998).\\n\\nFor the reasons above, we affirm the District Court\\u2019s dismissal of the Adams and Paul plaintiffs\\u2019 challenges to BCRA \\u00a7 307 for lack of standing.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7\\u00a7304, S16, and 319\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7\\u00a7304 and 316, which amend FECA \\u00a7315, and BCRA \\u00a7 319, which adds FECA \\u00a7 315A, collectively known as the \\u201cmillionaire provisions,\\u201d provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidate\\u2019s opponent spends a triggering amount *230of his personal fiinds.1 The provisions also eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances.2\\n\\nIn their challenge to the millionaire provisions, the Adams plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA \\u00a7307. For the reasons discussed above, they fail to allege a cognizable injury that is \\u201cfairly traceable\\u201d to BCRA. Additionally, as the District Court noted, \\u201cnone of the Adams plaintiffs is a candidate in an election affected by the millionaire provisions \\u2014 i. e., one in which an opponent chooses to spend the triggering amount in his own funds\\u2014 and it would be purely \\u2018conjectural\\u2019 for the court to assume that any plaintiff ever will be.\\u201d 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 431 (DC 2003) (case below) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560). We affirm the District Court\\u2019s dismissal of the Adams plaintiffs\\u2019 challenge to the millionaire provisions for lack of standing.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7311\\n\\nFECA \\u00a7318 requires that certain communications \\u201cauthorized\\u201d by a candidate or his political committee clearly identify the candidate or committee or, if not so authorized, identify the payor and announce the lack of authorization. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441d (2000 ed. and Supp. II). BCRA \\u00a7 311 makes several amendments to FECA \\u00a7318, among them the expansion of this identification regime to include disbursements for \\u201celectioneering communications\\u201d as defined in BCRA \\u00a7201.\\n\\n*231The McConnell and Chamber of Commerce plaintiffs challenge BCRA \\u00a7311 by simply noting that \\u00a7311, along with all of the \\u201celectioneering communications\\u201d provisions of BCRA, is unconstitutional. We disagree. We think BCRA \\u00a7311\\u2019s inclusion of electioneering communications in the FECA \\u00a7 318 disclosure regime bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of \\u201cshed[ding] the light of publicity\\u201d on campaign financing. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 81. Assuming as we must that FECA \\u00a7318 is valid to begin with, and that FECA \\u00a7318 is valid as amended by BCRA \\u00a7311\\u2019s amendments other than the inclusion of electioneering communications, the challenged inclusion of electioneering communications is not itself unconstitutional. We affirm the District Court\\u2019s decision upholding \\u00a7311\\u2019s expansion of FECA \\u00a7 318(a) to include disclosure of disbursements for electioneering communications.\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7318 .\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7 318, which adds FECA \\u00a7324, prohibits individuals \\u201c17 years old or younger\\u201d from making contributions to candidates and contributions or donations to political parties. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441k (Supp. II). The McConnell and Echols plaintiffs challenge the provision; they argue that \\u00a7318 violates the First Amendment rights of minors. We agree.\\n\\nMinors enjoy the protection of the First Amendment. See, e. g., Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511-513 (1969). Limitations on the amount that an individual may contribute to a candidate or political committee impinge on the protected freedoms of expression and association. See Buckley, supra, at 20-22. When the Government burdens the right to contribute, we apply heightened scrutiny. See ante, at 136 (joint opinion of Stevens and O\\u2019Connor, JJ.) (\\u201c[A] contribution limit involving even \\u2018\\u201csignificant interference\\u201d\\u2019 with associational rights is nevertheless valid if it satisfies the \\u2018lesser demand\\u2019 of being \\u2018 \\u201cclosely drawn\\u201d \\u2019 to match a \\u2018 \\u201csufficiently important *232interest\\u2019'\\u201d\\u2019 (quoting Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146, 162 (2003))). We ask whether there is a \\u201csufficiently important interest\\u201d and whether the statute is \\u201cclosely drawn\\u201d to avoid unnecessary abridgment of First Amendment freedoms. Ante, at 136; Buckley, supra, at 25. The Government asserts that the provision protects against corruption by conduit; that is, donations by parents through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents. But the Government offers scant evidence of this form of evasion.3 Perhaps the Government\\u2019s slim evidence results from sufficient deterrence of such activities by \\u00a7320 of FECA, which prohibits any person from \\u201cmak[ing] a contribution in the name of another person\\u201d or \\u201cknowingly accepting] a contribution made by one person in the name of another,\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441f. Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for \\u00a7 318 to withstand heightened scrutiny. See Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 391 (2000) (\\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised\\u201d).\\n\\nEven assuming, arguendo, the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive. The States have adopted a variety of more tailored approaches\\u2014 e.g., counting contributions by minors against the total permitted for a parent or family unit, imposing a lower cap on contributions by minors, and prohibiting contributions by very young children. Without deciding whether any of these alternatives is sufficiently tailored, we hold that the provision here sweeps too broadly. We therefore affirm the District Court\\u2019s decision striking down \\u00a7318 as unconstitutional.\\n\\n*233 BCRA \\u00a7m(b)\\n\\nThe National Right to Life plaintiffs argue that the District Court\\u2019s grant of intervention to the intervenor-defendants, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and BCRA \\u00a7 403(b), must be reversed because the intervenor-defendants lack Article III standing. It is clear, however, that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has standing, and therefore we need not address the standing of the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FEC\\u2019s. See, e. g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 431-432, n. 19 (1998); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714,721 (1986). Cf. Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54,68-69, n. 21 (1986) (reserving the question for another day).\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\\u2019s judgment finding the plaintiffs\\u2019 challenges to BCRA \\u00a7305, \\u00a7307, and the millionaire provisions nonjusticiable, striking down as unconstitutional BCRA \\u00a7318, and upholding BCRA \\u00a7311. The judgment of the District Court is\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\nJustice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Title V.*\\n\\nWe consider here the constitutionality of \\u00a7 504 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), amending the Communications Act of 1934. That section requires broadcasters to keep publicly available records of politically related broadcasting requests. 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(e) (Supp. II). The McConnell plaintiffs, who include the National Association of Broadcasters, argue that \\u00a7 504 imposes onerous administrative burdens, lacks any offsetting justification, and consequently violates the First Amendment. For similar reasons, the three judges on the District Court found BCRA \\u00a7504 unconstitutional on its face. 251 F. Supp. 2d *234176, 186 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (case below).

Reg. 1692 (1938) (47 CFR \\u00a736a4); 13 Fed. Reg. 7486 (1948) (47 CFR \\u00a7\\u00a7 3.190(d), 3.290(d), 3.690(d)); 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952) (47 CFR \\u00a7 3.590(d)); 19 Fed.

Mitch McConnell et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., p. 74 (hereinafter Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs). But we do not see how that could be so. The FCC has consistently estimated that its \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d regulation imposes upon each licensee an additional administrative burden of six to seven hours of work per year.. See 66 Fed. Reg. 37468 (2001); id., at 18090; 63 Fed. Reg. 26593 (1998); id., at 10379; 57 Fed. Reg. 18492 (1992); see also 66 Fed. Reg. 29963 (2001) (total annual burden of one hour per cable system). That burden means annual costs of a few hundred dollars at most, a microscopic amount compared to the many millions of dollars of revenue broadcasters receive from candidates who wish to advertise.\\n\\nPerhaps for this reason, broadcasters in the past did not strongly oppose the regulation or its extension. Cf., e. g., 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952) (\\u201cNo comments adverse to the adoption of the proposed rule have been received\\u201d); 43 Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978) (no adverse comments). Indeed in 1992, \\u201cCBS\\u201d itself \\u201csuggested] \\u201d that the candidate file \\u201cinclude a record of all requests for time.\\u201d 57 Fed. Reg. 206 (1992); cf. 63 Fed. Reg. *23649493 (1998) (FCC \\u201cnot persuaded that the current retention period [two years] is overly burdensome to licensees\\u201d).\\n\\nIn any event, as the FCC wrote in an analogous context, broadcaster recordkeeping requirements \\u201c \\u2018simply run with the territory.\\u2019\\u201d 40 Fed. Reg. 18398 (1975). Broadcasters must keep and make publicly available numerous records. See 47 CFR \\u00a773.3526 (2002) (general description of select recordkeeping requirements for commercial stations); see also \\u00a7\\u00a773.1202, 73.3526(e)(9)(i) (retention of all \\u201cwritten comments and suggestions [including letters and e-mail] received from the public regarding operation of the station\\u201d for three years); \\u00a7 73.1212(e) (sponsorship identification records, including the identification of a sponsoring entity\\u2019s executive officers and board-level members when sponsoring \\u201cpolitical matter or matter involving the discussion of a controversial issue of public importance\\u201d); \\u00a773.1840 (retention of station logs); \\u00a7 73.1942 (candidate broadcast records); \\u00a7 73.2080 (equal employment opportunities records); \\u00a7\\u00a7 73.3526(e)(ll)(i), (e)(12) (\\u201clist of programs that have provided the station\\u2019s most significant treatment of community issues during the preceding three month period,\\u201d including \\u201cbrief narrative describing [the issues, and] time, date, duration, and title\\u201d); \\u00a7\\u00a773.3526(e)(ll)(ii), (iii) (reports of children\\u2019s program, and retention of records sufficient to substantiate \\u201ccompliance with the commercial limits on children\\u2019s programming\\u201d); \\u00a7 73.3613(a) (network affiliation contracts); \\u00a7\\u00a7 73.3613(b), 73.3615, 73.3526(e)(5) (ownership-related reports); \\u00a7 73.3613(c) (\\u201c[m]anagement consultant agreements\\u201d); \\u00a7 73.3613(d) (\\u201c[t]ime brokerage agreements\\u201d). Compared to these longstanding recordkeeping requirements, an additional six to seven hours is a small drop in a very large bucket.\\n\\nThe McConnell plaintiffs also claim that the \\u201ccandidate requests\\u201d requirement fails significantly to further any important governmental interest. Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 74. But, again, we cannot agree. The FCC has pointed out *237that \\u201c[t]hese records are necessary to permit political candidates and others to verify that licensees have complied with their obligations relating to use of their facilities by candidates for political office\\u201d pursuant to the \\u201cequal time\\u201d provision of 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a). 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998). They also help the FCC determine whether broadcasters have violated their obligation to sell candidates time at the \\u201clowest unit charge.\\u201d 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(b). As reinforced by BCRA, the \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d requirements will help the FCC, the Federal Election Commission, and \\u201cthe public to evaluate whether broadcasters are processing [candidate] requests in an evenhanded fashion,\\u201d Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance 10, thereby helping to assure broadcasting fairness. 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969). They will help make the public aware of how much money candidates may be prepared to spend on broadcast messages. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 434 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); see ante, at 194-199 (joint opinion of STEVENS and O\\u2019Connor, JJ.) (hereinafter joint opinion). And they will provide an independently compiled set of data for purposes of verifying candidates\\u2019 compliance with the disclosure requirements and source limitations of BCRA and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7434; cf. Adventure Communications, Inc. v. Kentucky Registry of Election Finance, 191 F. 3d 429, 433 (CA4 1999) (candidate compliance verification); 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998) (FCC finding record retention provision provides public with \\u201cnecessary and adequate access\\u201d).\\n\\nWe note, too, that the FCC\\u2019s regulatory authority is broad. Red Lion, supra, at 380 (\\u201cbroad\\u201d mandate to assure broadcasters operate in public interest); National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 219 (1943) (same). And we have previously found broad governmental authority for agency information demands from regulated entities. Compare United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S. 632, 642-643 (1950); Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. *238186, 209 (1946); Donovan v. Lone Steer, Inc., 464 U. S. 408, 414-415 (1984).\\n\\nThe Chief Justice suggests that the Government has not made these particular claims. But it has \\u2014 though succinctly \\u2014 for it has cross-referenced the relevant regulatory rules. Compare post, at 359-361 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting), with Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance; Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 73-74; Brief for FEC et al. in No. 02-1674 et al., pp. 132-133. And succinctness through cross-reference was necessary given our procedural requirement that the Government set forth in a 140-page brief all its arguments concerning each of the 20 BCRA provisions here under contest. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 186-188.\\n\\nIn sum, given the Government\\u2019s reference to the 65-year-old FCC regulation and the related considerations we have mentioned, we cannot accept the argument that the constitutionality of the \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d provision lacks eviden-tiary support. The challengers have made no attempt to explain away the FCC\\u2019s own contrary conclusions and the mass of evidence in related FCC records and proceedings. E. g., 57 Fed. Reg. 189 (1992); cf. supra, at 235-236; ante, at 222-223 (joint opinion) (upholding BCRA\\u2019s coordination provision based, in part, on prior experience under similar provision). Because we cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, we likewise cannot strike down the \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d provision in BCRA \\u00a7 504; for the latter simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.\\n\\nM H-\\u00cd\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7504\\u2019s \\u201celection message request requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the public) to broadcast a \\u201cmessage\\u201d about \\u201ca legally qualified candidate\\u201d or \\u201cany election to Federal office.\\u201d 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7315(e)(l)(B)(i), (ii) (Supp. II). Although these requirements are somewhat broader than the *239\\u201ccandidate request\\u201d requirement, they serve much the same purposes. A candidate\\u2019s supporters or opponents account for many of the requests to broadcast \\u201cmessagefs]\\u201d about a \\u201ccandidate.\\u201d Requests to broadcast messages about an \\u201celection\\u201d may include messages that favor one candidate or another, along with other messages that may be more neutral.\\n\\nGiven the nature of many of the messages, recordkeeping can help both the regulatory agencies and the public evaluate broadcasting fairness, and determine the amount of money that individuals or groups, supporters or opponents, intend to spend to help elect a particular candidate. Cf. ante, at 206-207 (joint opinion) (upholding stringent restrictions on all election-time advertising that refers to a candidate because such advertising will often convey message of support or opposition). Insofar as the request is to broadcast neutral material about a candidate or election, the disclosure can help the FCC carry out other statutory functions, for example, determining whether a broadcasting station is fulfilling its licensing obligation to broadcast material important to the community and the public. 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a) (\\u201cobligation ... to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance\\u201d); 47 CFR \\u00a773.1910 (2002); \\u00a7\\u00a773.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements for issues important to the community).\\n\\nFor reasons previously discussed, supra, at 235-236, and on the basis of the material presented, we cannot say that these requirements will impose disproportionate administrative burdens. They ask the broadcaster to keep information about the disposition of the request, and information identifying the individual or company requesting the broadcast time (name, address, contact information, or, if the requester is not an individual, the names of company officials). 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(e)(2) (Supp. II). Insofar as the \\u201crequest\\u201d is made by a candidate\\u2019s \\u201csupporters,\\u201d the \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d regulation apparently already requires broadcasters *240to keep such records. 43 Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978). Regardless, the information should prove readily available, for the individual requesting a broadcast must provide it to the broadcaster should the broadcaster accept the request. 47 CFR \\u00a7 73.1212(e) (2002). And as we have previously pointed out, the recordkeeping requirements do not reach significantly beyond other FCC recordkeeping rules, for example, those requiring broadcasting licensees to keep material showing compliance with their license-related promises to broadcast material on issues of public importance. See, e. g., \\u00a7\\u00a773.3526(e)(ll)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements for issues important to the community); supra, at 236 (collecting regulations); Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 707 F. 2d 1413, 1421-1422 (CADC 1983) (describing FCC rules, in force during 1960-1981, that required nonentertainment programming in 14 specific areas and mandated publicly available records detailing date, time, source, and description to substantiate compliance). If, as we have held, the \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d requirements are constitutional, supra, at 238, the \\u201celection message\\u201d requirements, which serve, similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden, must be constitutional as well.\\n\\n<!\\n\\nThe \\u201cissue request\\u201d requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the public) to broadcast \\u201cmessage[s]\\u201d about \\u201ca national legislative issue of public importance\\u201d or \\u201cany political matter of national importance.\\u201d 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 315(e)(1)(B), (e)(l)(B)(iii) (Supp. II). These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help the FCC determine whether broadcasters are carrying out their \\u201cobligations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance,\\u201d 47 CFR \\u00a773.1910 (2002), and whether broadcasters are too heavily favoring entertainment, and discriminating *241against broadcasts devoted to public affairs, see ibid.; 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a); Red Lion, 395 U. S., at 380.\\n\\nThe McConnell plaintiffs claim that the statutory language \\u2014 \\\"political matter of national importance\\u201d or \\u201cnational legislative issue of public importance\\u201d \\u2014 is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 74-75. But that language is no more general than the language that Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters. Compare 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(e)(1)(B) (Supp. II) (\\u201cpolitical matter of national importance\\u201d) and \\u00a7 315(e)(l)(B)(iii) (\\u201cnational legislative issue of public importance\\u201d) (both added by BCRA \\u00a7504), with 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(a) (\\u201cobligation ... to operate in the public interest\\u201d and to afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of \\u201cissues of public importance\\u201d); \\u00a7 317(a)(2) (FCC disclosure requirements relating to any \\u201cpolitical program\\u201d or \\u201cdiscussion of any controversial issue\\u201d); cf. 47 CFR \\u00a7 73.1212(e) (2002) (\\u201cpolitical matter or ... a controversial issue of public importance\\u201d) and 9 Fed. Reg. 14734 (1944) (\\u201cpublic controversial issues\\u201d); ante, at 222-223 (joint opinion) (noting that the experience under longstanding regulations undermines claims of chilling effect). And that language is also roughly comparable to other language in BCRA that we uphold today. E.g., ante, at 169-170, and n. 64 (joint opinion) (upholding 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7431(20)(A)(iii) (Supp. II) (\\u201cpublic communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . . and that promotes or. supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office\\u201d)); ante, at 222-223 (upholding 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441a(a)(7)(B)(ii) (Supp. II) (counting as coordinated disbursements that are made \\u201cin cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of [a political party]\\u201d) against challenge and noting that an \\u201cagreement\\u201d is not necessary for precision).\\n\\nWhether these requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens is more difficult to say. On the one *242hand, the burdens are likely less heavy than many that other PCC regulations have imposed, for example, the burden of keeping and disclosing \\u201c[a]ll written comments and suggestions\\u201d received from the public, including every e-mail. 47 CFR \\u00a7\\u00a773.1202, 73.3526(e)(9) (2002); see also supra, at 236. On the other hand, the burdens are likely heavier than those imposed by BCRA \\u00a7 504\\u2019s other provisions, previously discussed.\\n\\nThe regulatory burden, in practice, will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies this provision. The FCC has adequate legal authority to write regulations that may limit, and make more specific, the provision\\u2019s potential linguistic reach. 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(d). It has often ameliorated regulatory burdens by interpretation in the past, and there is no reason to believe it will not do so here. See 14 FCC Red. 4653, 4665, \\u00b6 25 (1999) (relaxing the recordkeeping requirements in respect to cable systems that serve fewer than 5,000 subscribers); 14 FCC Red. 11113, 11121-11122, \\u00b6\\u00b6 20-22 (1999) (requiring candidates to inspect the political file at a station rather than requiring licensees to send out photocopies of the files to candidates upon telephone request). The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC in regulations, or as otherwise applied. Any such challenge will likely provide greater information about the provisions\\u2019 justifications and administrative burdens. Without that additional information, we cannot now say that the burdens are so great, or the justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding the provisions unconstitutional on their face.\\n\\nThe McConnell plaintiffs and The Chief Justice make one final claim. They say that the \\u201cissue request\\u201d requirement will force them to disclose information that will reveal their political strategies to opponents, perhaps prior to a broadcast. See post, at 362 (dissenting opinion). We are willing to assume that the Constitution includes some form of protection against premature disclosure of campaign strat*243egy \\u2014 though, given the First Amendment interest in free and open discussion of campaign issues, we make this assumption purely for argument\\u2019s sake. Nonetheless, even on that assumption we do not see how BCRA \\u00a7 504 can be unconstitutional on its face.\\n\\nFor one thing, the statute requires disclosure of names, addresses, and the fact of a request; it does not require disclosure of substantive campaign content. See 47 U. S. C. \\u00a7 315(e)(2) (Supp. II). For another, the statutory words \\u201cas soon as possible,\\u201d \\u00a7 315(e)(3), would seem to permit FCC disclosure-timing rules that would avoid any premature disclosure that the Constitution itself would forbid. Further, the plaintiffs do not point to \\u2014 and our own research cannot find \\u2014 any specific indication of such a \\u201cstrategy-disclosure\\u201d problem arising during the past 65 years in respect to the existing FCC \\u201ccandidate request\\u201d requirement, where the strategic problem might be expected to be more acute. Finally, we today reject an analogous facial attack \\u2014 premised on speculations of \\u201cadvance disclosure\\u201d \\u2014 on a similar BCRA provision. See ante, at 200-201 (joint opinion). Thus, the \\u201cstrategy disclosure\\u201d argument does not show that BCRA \\u00a7 504 is unconstitutional on its face, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when \\u00a7 504 is applied.\\n\\ny\\n\\nThe Chief Justice makes two important arguments in response to those we have set forth. First, he says that we \\u201capproac[h] \\u00a7 504 almost exclusively from the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association rights are affected.\\u201d Post, at 359 (dissenting opinion). The Chief Justice is certainly correct in emphasizing the importance of the speech interests of candidates and other potential speakers, but we have not ignored their First Amendment \\u201cperspective.\\u201d\\n\\n*244To the contrary, we have discussed the speakers\\u2019 interests together with the broadcasters\\u2019 interests because the two sets of interests substantially overlap. For example, the speakers\\u2019 vagueness argument is no different from the broadcasters\\u2019, and it fails for the same reasons, e. g., the fact that BCRA \\u00a7 504\\u2019s language is just as definite and precise as other language that we today uphold. See supra, at 241.\\n\\nWe have separately discussed the one and only speech-related claim advanced on behalf of candidates (or other speakers) that differs from the claims set forth by the broadcasters. See supra, at 242-243. This is the claim that the statute\\u2019s disclosure requirements will require candidates to reveal their political strategies to opponents. We just said, and we now repeat, that BCRA \\u00a7504 can be applied, in a significant number of cases, without requiring any such political-strategy disclosure \\u2014 either because disclosure in many cases will not create any such risk or because the FCC may promulgate rules requiring disclosure only after any such risk disappears, or both.\\n\\nMoreover, candidates (or other speakers) whom \\u00a7504 affects adversely in this way (or in other ways) remain free to challenge the lawfulness of FCC implementing regulations and to challenge the constitutionality of \\u00a7 504 as applied. To find that the speech-related interests of candidates and others may be vindicated in an as-applied challenge is not to \\u201cignor[e]\\u201d those interests.\\n\\nSecond, The Chief Justice says that \\u201cthe Government, in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support \\u00a7 504 as a whole,\\u201d adding that the existence of \\u201cpre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing similar disclosure requirements\\u201d cannot \\u201ccompel the conclusion that \\u00a7 504 is constitutional,\\u201d nor somehow \\u201crelieve the Government of its burden of advancing a constitutionally sufficient justification for \\u00a7 504.\\u201d Post, at 359-360, 361 (dissenting opinion).\\n\\nAgain The Chief Justice is correct in saying that the mere existence of similar FCC regulation-imposed require*245ments \\u2014 even if unchallenged for at least 65 years \\u2014 cannot prove that those requirements are constitutional. But the existence of those regulations means that we must read beyond the briefs in these cases before holding those requirements unconstitutional. Before evaluating the relevant burdens and justifications, we must at least become acquainted with the FCC\\u2019s own view of the matter. We must follow the Government\\u2019s regulation-related references to the relevant regulatory records, related FCC regulatory conclusions, and the FCC\\u2019s enforcement experience. We must take into account, for example, the likelihood that the reason there is \\u201cnothing in the record that indicates licensees have treated purchasers unfairly,\\u201d post, at 361 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting), is that for many decades similar FCC regulations have made that unfair treatment unlawful. And, if we are to avoid disrupting related agency law, we must evaluate what we find in agency records and related experience before holding this similar statutory provision unconstitutional on its face.\\n\\nEven a superficial examination of those relevant agency materials reveals strong supporting justifications, and a lack of significant administrative burdens. And any additional burden that the statute, viewed facially, imposes upon interests protected by the First Amendment seems slight compared to the strong enforcement-related interests that it serves. Given the FCC regulations and their history, the statutory requirements must survive a facial attack under any potentially applicable First Amendment standard, including that of heightened scrutiny.\\n\\nThat is why the regulations are relevant. That is why the brevity of the Government\\u2019s discussion here cannot be determinative. That is why we fear that The Chief Justice\\u2019s contrary view would lead us into an unfortunate \\u2014 and at present unjustified \\u2014 revolution in communications law. And that is why we disagree with his dissent.\\n\\n*246The portion of the judgment of the District Court invalidating BCR A \\u00a7 504 is reversed.\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT\\n\\nTitle 47 U.

Supp. 2d, at 468 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).\\n\\nJustice Kennedy accuses us of engaging in a sleight of hand by conflating \\u201cunseemly corporate speech\\u201d with the speech of political parties and candidates, and then adverting to the \\u201ccorporate speech rationale as if it were the linchpin of the case.\\u201d Post, at 290-291 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). This is incorrect. The principles set forth here and relied upon in assessing Title I are the same principles articulated in Buckley and its progeny that regulations of contributions to candidates, parties, and political committees are subject to less rigorous scrutiny than direct restraints on speech \\u2014 including \\u201cunseemly corporate speech.\\u201d\\n\\nSince our decision in Buckley, we have consistently applied less rigorous scrutiny to contribution restrictions aimed at the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption. See, e. g., 424 U. S., at 23-36 (applying less rigorous scrutiny to FECA\\u2019s $1,000 limit on individual contributions to a candidate and FECA\\u2019s $5,000 limit on PAC contributions to a candidate); id., at 38 (applying less rigorous scrutiny to FECA\\u2019s $25,000 aggregate yearly limit on contributions to candidates, political party committees, and political committees); California Medical Assn. v.

S. 146,161-162 (2003) (applying less rigorous scrutiny to provisions intended to prevent circumvention of otherwise valid contribution limits).\\n\\nIndeed, Congress structured \\u00a7 323(b) in such a way as to free individual, corporate, and union donations to state committees for nonfederal elections from federal source and amount restrictions.\\n\\nJustice Kennedy\\u2019s contention that less rigorous scrutiny applies only to regulations burdening political association, rather than political speech, misreads Buckley. In Buckley, we recognized that contribution limits burden both protected speech and association, though they generally have more significant impacts on the latter. 424 U. S., at 20-22. We nevertheless applied less rigorous scrutiny to FECA\\u2019s contribution limits because neither burden was sufficiently weighty to overcome Congress\\u2019 countervailing interest in protecting the integrity of the political process. See Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 388 (2000) (\\u201cWhile we did not [in Buckley] attempt to parse [the] distinctions between the speech and association standards of scrutiny for contribution limits, we did make it clear that those restrictions bore more heavily on the associational right than on [the] freedom to speak. We consequently proceeded on the understanding that a contribution limitation surviving a claim of associational abridgment would survive a speech challenge as well, and we held the standard satisfied by the contribution limits under review\\u201d (citation omitted)). It is thus simply untrue in the campaign finance context that all \\u201cburdens on speech necessitate strict scrutiny review.\\u201d Post, at 312.\\n\\nJustice Kennedy is no doubt correct that the associational burdens imposed by a particular piece of campaign-finance regulation may at times be so severe as to warrant strict scrutiny. Post, at 311. In light of our interpretation of \\u00a7 323(a), however, see infra, at 161, \\u00a7323 does not present such a case. As Justice Kennedy himself acknowledges, even \\u201csignificant interference\\u201d with \\u201cprotected rights of association\\u201d are subject to less rigorous scrutiny. Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 162; see post, at 311. There is thus nothing inconsistent in our decision to account for the particular associational burdens imposed by \\u00a7 323(a) when applying the appropriate level of scrutiny.\\n\\nThe fact that the post-1990 explosion in soft-money spending on federal electioneering was accompanied by a series of efforts in Congress to clamp down on such uses of soft money (culminating, of course, in BCR A) *143underscores the fact that the FEC regulations permitted more than Congress, in enacting FECA, had ever intended. See J. Cantor, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress: Campaign Finance Legislation in the 101st Congress (1990) (9 bills seeking to limit the influence of soft money introduced); J. Cantor, CRS Report for Congress: Campaign Finance Legislation in the 102d Congress (1991) (10 such bills introduced); J. Cantor, CRS Report for Congress: Campaign Finance Legislation in the 103d Congress (1993) (16 bills); J.

Supp. 2d, at 201-206 (per curiam) (discussing legislative efforts to curb soft money in 105th and subsequent Congresses).\\n\\nJustice Kennedy contends that the plurality\\u2019s observation in Colorado I that large soft-money donations to a political party pose little threat of corruption \\u201cestablish[es] that\\u201d such contributions are not corrupting. Post, at 301 (citing Colorado I, 518 U. S. 604, 616, 617-618 (1996)). The cited dictum has no bearing on the present cases. Colorado I addressed an entirely different question \\u2014 namely, whether Congress could permissi*146bly limit a party's independent expenditures \\u2014 and did so on an entirely different set of facts. It also had before it an evidentiary record frozen in 1990 \\u2014 well before the soft-money explosion of the 1990\\u2019s. See Federal Election Comm\\u2019n v. Colorado Republican Fed.

Labor and business leaders believe \\u2014 based on experience and with good reason \\u2014 that such access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.\\u2019 \\u201d 251 F.

As one CEO explained:\\n\\n    \\u201c \\u2018[I]f you\\u2019re giving a lot of soft money to one side, the other side knows. For many economically-oriented donors, there is a risk in giving to only one side, because the other side may read through FEC reports and have staff or a friendly lobbyist call and indicate that someone with interests before a certain committee has had their contributions to the other side noticed. They\\u2019ll get a message that basically asks: \\u201cAre you sure you want to be giving only to one side? Don\\u2019t you want to have friends on both sides of the aisle?\\u201d If your interests are subject to anger from the other side of the aisle, you need to fear that you may suffer a penalty if you don\\u2019t give....

(quoting Randlett Decl. \\u00b6 12, App. 715); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 868 (Leon, J.) (same).\\n\\nIn addition to finding no support in our recent cases, see, e. g., Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441 (defining corruption more broadly than quid pro quo arrangements); Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 389 (same), JUSTICE Kennedy\\u2019s contention that Buckley limits Congress to regulating contributions to a candidate ignores Buckley itself. There, we upheld FECA\\u2019s $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to candidates, political committees, and party committees out of recognition that FECA\\u2019s $1,000 limit on candidate contributions would be meaningless if individuals could instead make \\u201chuge contributions to the candidate\\u2019s political party.\\u201d 424 U. S., at 38. Likewise, in California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm\\u2019n, 453 U. S. 182 (1981), we upheld FECA\\u2019s $5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political committees. It is no answer to say that such limits were justified as a means of preventing individuals from using parties and political committees as pass-throughs to circumvent FECA\\u2019s $1,000 limit on individual contributions to candidates. Given FECA\\u2019s definition of \\u201ccontribution,\\u201d the $5,000 and $25,000 limits restricted not only the source and amount of funds available to parties and political committees to make candidate contributions, but also the source and amount of funds available to engage in express advocacy and numerous other non-coordinated expenditures. If indeed the First Amendment prohibited Congress from regulating contributions to fund the latter, the otherwise-easy-to-remedy exploitation of parties as pass-throughs (e. g., a strict limit *153on donations that could be used to fund candidate contributions) would have provided insufficient justification for such overbroad legislation.\\n\\nAt another point, describing our \\u201cflawed reasoning,\\u201d Justice Kennedy seems to suggest that Congress\\u2019 interest in regulating the appear-\\u00e1nce of corruption extends only to those contributions that actually \\u201ccreate. . .. corrupt donor favoritism among ... officeholders.\\u201d Post, at 299-300. This latter formulation would render Congress\\u2019 interest in stemming the appearance of corruption indistinguishable from its interest in preventing actual corruption.\\n\\nIn support of this claim, the political party plaintiffs assert that, in 2001, the RNC spent $15.6 million of nonfederal funds (30% of the nonfed-eral amount raised that year) on purely state and local election activity, including contributions to state and local candidates, transfers to state parties, and direct spending. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 102-103 (statement of counsel Bobby R. Burchfield); 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 336-337 (Henderson, J.); id., at 464-465 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 830 (Leon, J.).\\n\\nThe close relationship of federal officeholders and candidates to their parties answers not only The Chief Justice\\u2019s concerns about \\u00a7 323(a), but also his fear that our analysis of \\u00a7 323\\u2019s remaining provisions bespeaks no limiting principle. Post, at 355-356 (dissenting opinion). As set forth in our discussion of those provisions, the record demonstrates close ties between federal officeholders and the state and local committees of their parties. That close relationship makes state and local parties effective conduits for donors desiring to corrupt federal candidates and officeholders. Thus, in upholding \\u00a7\\u00a7 323(b), (d), and (f), we rely not only on the fact that they regulate contributions used to fund activities influencing federal elections, but also that they regulate contributions to, or at the behest of, entities uniquely positioned to serve as conduits for corruption. We agree with The Chief Justice that Congress could not regulate financial contributions to political talk show hosts or newspaper editors on the sole *157basis that their activities conferred a benefit on the candidate. Post, at 355 (dissenting opinion).\\n\\nPlaintiffs claim that the option of soliciting hard money for state and local candidates is an illusory one, since several States prohibit state and local candidates from establishing multiple campaign accounts, which would preclude them from establishing separate accounts for federal funds. See Cal. Fair Pol. Praets. Comm\\u2019n Advisory Op. A-91-448 (Dec. 16, 1991), 1991 WL 772902; Colo. Const., Art. XXVIII, \\u00a72(3); Iowa Code \\u00a756.5A (2003); and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \\u00a73517.10(J) (Anderson Supp. 2002). Plaintiffs maintain that \\u00a7 323(a) combines with these state laws to make it impossible for state and local candidates to receive hard-money donations. But the challenge we are considering is a facial one, and on its face \\u00a7 323(a) permits solicitations. The fact that a handful of States might interfere with the mechanism Congress has chosen for such solicitations is an argument that may be addressed in an as-applied challenge.\\n\\nEven opponents of campaign finance reform acknowledged that \\u201ca prohibition of soft money donations to national party committees alone would be wholly ineffective.\\u201d The Constitution and Campaign Reform: Hearings on S. 522 before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., 301 (2000) (statement of Bobby R.

In effect, \\u00a7 323(e)(1)(B) doubles the limits on what individuals can contribute to or at the behest of federal candidates and officeholders, while restricting the use of the additional funds to activities not related to federal elections. If the federal candidate or officeholder is also a candidate for state or local office, he or she may solicit, receive, and spend an unlimited amount of nonfederal money in connection with that election, subject only to state regulation and the requirement that such solicitation or expenditures refer only to the relevant state or local office. 2 U.

Any concern that Congress might opportunistically *186pass campaign-finance regulation for self-serving ends is taken into account by the applicable level of scrutiny.

There was also evidence that in the 12-month period before trial 22 SWP members, including 4 in Ohio, were fired because of their party membership. Although appellants contend that two of the Ohio firings were not politically motivated, the evidence amply supports the District Court\\u2019s conclusion that \\u2018private hostility and harassment toward SWP members make it difficult for them to maintain employment.\\u2019 The District Court also found a past history of Government harassment of the SWP.\\u201d Brown v.

Prior to BCRA, FECA \\u00a7 316(a) made it \\u201cunlawful... for any corporation whatever, or any labor organization, to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with\\u201d certain federal elections. 2 U.

The premise that apparently underlies Justice Kennedy\\u2019s principal submission is a conclusion that the two categories of speech are nevertheless entitled to the same constitutional protection. If that is correct, Justice Kennedy must take issue with the basic holding in Buckley and, indeed, with our recognition in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978), that unusually important interests underlie the regulation of corporations\\u2019 campaign-related speech. In Bellotti we cited Buckley, among other cases, for the proposition that \\u201c[p]reserving the integrity of the electoral *207process, preventing corruption, and \\u2018sustaining] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of the government\\u2019 are interests of the highest importance.\\u201d 435 U. S., at 788-789 (citations and footnote omitted). \\u201cPreservation of the individual citizen\\u2019s confidence in government,\\u201d we added, \\u201cis equally important.\\u201d Id,., at 789. BCRA\\u2019s fidelity to those imperatives sets it apart from the statute in Bellotti \\u2014 and, for that matter, from the Ohio statute banning the distribution of anonymous campaign literature, struck down in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995).\\n\\nIn a different but somewhat related argument, one set of plaintiffs contends that political campaigns and issue advocacy involve press activities, and that BCRA therefore interferes with speakers\\u2019 rights under the Freedom of the Press Clause. U. S. Const., Arndt. 1. We affirm the District Court\\u2019s conclusion that this contention lacks merit.\\n\\nThe statutory scheme is somewhat complex. In its provision dealing with \\u201cRules Relating to Electioneering Communications,\\u201d BCRA \\u00a7203(c)(2) (adding FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(2)) makes a blanket exception for designated nonprofit organizations, which reads as follows:\\n\\n    \\u201cException\\n\\n    \\u201cNotwithstanding paragraph (I), the term \\u2018applicable electioneering communication\\u2019 does not include a communication by a section 501(c)(4) organization or a political organization (as defined in section 527(e)(1) of title 26) made under section 434(f)(2)(E) or (F) of this title if the communication is paid for exclusively by funds provided directly by individuals who are United States citizens or nationals or lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as defined in section 1101(a)(20) of title 8). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term \\u2018provided directly by individuals\\u2019 does not include binds the source of which is an entity described in subsection (a) of this section.\\u201d 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7441b(c)(2) (Supp. II).\\n\\nBCRA \\u00a7204, however, amends FECA \\u00a7 316(c) to exclude \\u201ctargeted communications\\\" from that exception. New FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(6) states that the \\u00a7 316(c)(2) exception \\u201cshall not apply in the case of a targeted communication that is made by an organization described\\u201d in \\u00a7 316(b)(2). 2 U. S. C. \\u00a7 441b(c)(6)(A). Subparagraph (B) then defines the term \\u201ctargeted communication\\u201d for the purpose of the provision as including all *210electioneering communications. The parties and the judges on the District Court have assumed that amended FECA \\u00a7 316(c)(6) completely canceled the exemption for nonprofit corporations set forth in \\u00a7 316(c)(2). 251 F.

Trump, who seeks the Presidential\\nnomination of the Republican Party in this year\\u2019s election,\\nfrom becoming President again. The Colorado Supreme\\nCourt agreed with that contention. It ordered the Colorado\\nsecretary of state to exclude the former President from the\\nRepublican primary ballot in the State and to disregard any\\nwrite-in votes that Colorado voters might cast for him.\\n  Former President Trump challenges that decision on sev-\\neral grounds. Because the Constitution makes Congress,\\nrather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3\\nagainst federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.\\n                             I\\n  Last September, about six months before the March 5,\\n2024, Colorado primary election, four Republican and two\\nunaffiliated Colorado voters filed a petition against former\\nPresident Trump and Colorado Secretary of State Jena\\nGriswold in Colorado state court.

One consequence of those actions, the respondents\\nmaintain, is that former President Trump is constitution-\\nally ineligible to serve as President again.\\n   Their theory turns on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment. Section 3 provides:\\n    \\u201cNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Con-\\n    gress, or elector of President and Vice President, or\\n    hold any office, civil or military, under the United\\n    States, or under any State, who, having previously\\n    taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer\\n    of the United States, or as a member of any State leg-\\n    islature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any\\n    State, to support the Constitution of the United States,\\n    shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against\\n    the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies\\n    thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of\\n    each House, remove such disability.\\u201d\\n   According to the respondents, Section 3 applies to the for-\\nmer President because after taking the Presidential oath in\\n2017, he intentionally incited the breaching of the Capitol\\non January 6 in order to retain power. They claim that he\\nis therefore not a qualified candidate, and that as a result,\\nthe Colorado secretary of state may not place him on the\\nprimary ballot. See \\n\\nColo. Rev.

See City of Boerne v.\\nFlores, \\n\\n521 U. S. 507\\n\\n, 536 (1997).

We conclude\\nthat States may disqualify persons holding or attempting\\nto hold state office. But States have no power under the\\nConstitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal of-\\nfices, especially the Presidency.\\n    \\u201cIn our federal system, the National Government pos-\\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain\\nthe remainder.\\u201d Bond v.

And after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,\\nStates used this authority to disqualify state officers in ac-\\ncordance with state statutes. See, e.g., Worthy v. Barrett,\\n\\n63 N.

Because federal offic-\\ners \\u201c \\u2018owe their existence and functions to the united voice\\nof the whole, not of a portion, of the people,\\u2019 \\u201d powers over\\ntheir election and qualifications must be specifically \\u201cdele-\\ngated to, rather than reserved by, the States.\\u201d U.

Indeed, consistent with that princi-\\nple, States lack even the lesser powers to issue writs of\\nmandamus against federal officials or to grant habeas cor-\\npus relief to persons in federal custody.

The\\nterms of the Amendment speak only to enforcement by Con-\\ngress, which enjoys power to enforce the Amendment\\nthrough legislation pursuant to Section 5.\\n   This can hardly come as a surprise, given that the sub-\\nstantive provisions of the Amendment \\u201cembody significant\\nlimitations on state authority.\\u201d Fitzpatrick v.

On the other hand, the Fourteenth\\nAmendment grants new power to Congress to enforce the\\n\\f8                        TRUMP v. ANDERSON\\n\\n                                Per Curiam\\n\\nprovisions of the Amendment against the States. It would\\nbe incongruous to read this particular Amendment as\\ngranting the States the power\\u2014silently no less\\u2014to disqual-\\nify a candidate for federal office.\\n   The only other plausible constitutional sources of such a\\ndelegation are the Elections and Electors Clauses, which\\nauthorize States to conduct and regulate congressional and\\nPresidential elections, respectively. See Art. I, \\u00a74, cl. 1;\\nArt. II, \\u00a71, cl. 2.1 But there is little reason to think that\\nthese Clauses implicitly authorize the States to enforce Sec-\\ntion 3 against federal officeholders and candidates. Grant-\\ning the States that authority would invert the Fourteenth\\nAmendment\\u2019s rebalancing of federal and state power.\\n   The text of Section 3 reinforces these conclusions. Its fi-\\nnal sentence empowers Congress to \\u201cremove\\u201d any Section 3\\n\\u201cdisability\\u201d by a two-thirds vote of each house. The text im-\\nposes no limits on that power, and Congress may exercise it\\nany time, as the respondents concede. See Brief for Re-\\nspondents 50. In fact, historically, Congress sometimes ex-\\nercised this amnesty power postelection to ensure that\\nsome of the people\\u2019s chosen candidates could take office.2\\nBut if States were free to enforce Section 3 by barring can-\\ndidates from running in the first place, Congress would be\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n   1 The Elections Clause directs, in relevant part, that \\u201c[t]he Times,\\n\\nPlaces and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representa-\\ntives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\\u201d Art.\\nI, \\u00a74, cl. 1. The Electors Clause similarly provides that \\u201c[e]ach State\\nshall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a\\nNumber of Electors,\\u201d who in turn elect the President. Art. II, \\u00a71, cl. 2.\\n   2 Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, for instance,\\n\\nCongress enacted a private bill to remove the Section 3 disability of Nel-\\nson Tift of Georgia, who had recently been elected to represent the State\\nin Congress. See ch. 393, \\n\\n15 Stat. 427\\n\\n. Tift took his seat in Congress\\nimmediately thereafter. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 4499\\u2013\\n4500 (1868). Congress similarly acted postelection to remove the disa-\\nbilities of persons elected to state and local offices. See Cong. Globe, 40th\\nCong., 3d Sess., 29\\u201330, 120\\u2013121 (1868); ch. 5, \\n\\n15 Stat. 435\\n\\n\\u2013436.\\n\\f                    Cite as: \\n\\n601 U.

Perhaps a State may burden con-\\ngressional authority in such a way when it exercises its \\u201cex-\\nclusive\\u201d sovereign power over its own state offices. Taylor,\\n178 U. S., at 571. But it is implausible to suppose that the\\nConstitution affirmatively delegated to the States the au-\\nthority to impose such a burden on congressional power\\nwith respect to candidates for federal office. Cf. McCulloch\\nv. Maryland, \\n\\n4 Wheat. 316\\n\\n, 436 (1819) (\\u201cStates have no\\npower . . . to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner con-\\ntrol, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by\\nCongress\\u201d).\\n  Nor have the respondents identified any tradition of state\\nenforcement of Section 3 against federal officeholders or\\ncandidates in the years following ratification of the Four-\\nteenth Amendment.3 Such a lack of historical precedent is\\ngenerally a \\u201c \\u2018telling indication\\u2019 \\u201d of a \\u201c \\u2018severe constitutional\\nproblem\\u2019 \\u201d with the asserted power. United States v. Texas,\\n\\n599 U. S. 670\\n\\n, 677 (2023) (quoting Free Enterprise Fund v.\\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., \\n\\n561 U. S. 477\\n\\n,\\n505 (2010)). And it is an especially telling sign here, be-\\ncause as noted, States did disqualify persons from holding\\nstate offices following ratification of the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment. That pattern of disqualification with respect to state,\\nbut not federal offices provides \\u201cpersuasive evidence of a\\ngeneral understanding\\u201d that the States lacked enforcement\\npower with respect to the latter. U. S. Term Limits, 514\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n   3 We are aware of just one example of state enforcement against a\\n\\nwould-be federal officer. In 1868, the Governor of Georgia refused to\\ncommission John Christy, who had won the most votes in a congressional\\nelection, because\\u2014in the Governor\\u2019s view\\u2014Section 3 made Christy inel-\\nigible to serve. But the Governor\\u2019s determination was not final; a com-\\nmittee of the House reviewed Christy\\u2019s qualifications itself and recom-\\nmended that he not be seated. The full House never acted on the matter,\\nand Christy was never seated. See 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House\\nof Representatives \\u00a7459, pp. 470\\u2013472 (1907).\\n\\f10                  TRUMP v. ANDERSON\\n\\n                          Per Curiam\\n\\nU. S., at 826.\\n   Instead, it is Congress that has long given effect to Sec-\\ntion 3 with respect to would-be or existing federal office-\\nholders. Shortly after ratification of the Amendment, Con-\\ngress enacted the Enforcement Act of 1870. That Act\\nauthorized federal district attorneys to bring civil actions in\\nfederal court to remove anyone holding nonlegislative of-\\nfice\\u2014federal or state\\u2014in violation of Section 3, and made\\nholding or attempting to hold office in violation of Section 3\\na federal crime. \\u00a7\\u00a714, 15, \\n\\n16 Stat. 143\\n\\n\\u2013144 (repealed, \\n\\n35\\nStat. 1153\\n\\n\\u20131154, \\n\\n62 Stat. 992\\n\\n\\u2013993). In the years following\\nratification, the House and Senate exercised their unique\\npowers under Article I to adjudicate challenges contending\\nthat certain prospective or sitting Members could not take\\nor retain their seats due to Section 3. See Art. I, \\u00a75, cls. 1,\\n2; 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7459\\u2013463, pp. 470\\u2013486 (1907). And the Confiscation Act\\nof 1862, which predated Section 3, effectively provided an\\nadditional procedure for enforcing disqualification. That\\nlaw made engaging in insurrection or rebellion, among\\nother acts, a federal crime punishable by disqualification\\nfrom holding office under the United States. See \\u00a7\\u00a72, 3, \\n\\n12\\nStat. 590\\n\\n. A successor to those provisions remains on the\\nbooks today. See \\n\\n18 U. S. C. \\u00a72383\\n\\n.\\n   Moreover, permitting state enforcement of Section 3\\nagainst federal officeholders and candidates would raise se-\\nrious questions about the scope of that power. Section 5\\nlimits congressional legislation enforcing Section 3, because\\nSection 5 is strictly \\u201cremedial.\\u201d City of Boerne, \\n\\n521 U. S., at\\n520\\n\\n. To comply with that limitation, Congress \\u201cmust tailor\\nits legislative scheme to remedying or preventing\\u201d the spe-\\ncific conduct the relevant provision prohibits. Florida Pre-\\npaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings\\nBank, \\n\\n527 U. S. 627\\n\\n, 639 (1999).

Any congressional legislation\\nenforcing Section 3 must, like the Enforcement Act of 1870\\nand \\u00a72383, reflect \\u201ccongruence and proportionality\\u201d be-\\ntween preventing or remedying that conduct \\u201cand the\\nmeans adopted to that end.\\u201d City of Boerne, \\n\\n521 U. S., at\\n520\\n\\n. Neither we nor the respondents are aware of any other\\nlegislation by Congress to enforce Section 3. See Tr. of Oral\\nArg. 123.\\n    Any state enforcement of Section 3 against federal office-\\nholders and candidates, though, would not derive from Sec-\\ntion 5, which confers power only on \\u201c[t]he Congress.\\u201d As a\\nresult, such state enforcement might be argued to sweep\\nmore broadly than congressional enforcement could under\\nour precedents. But the notion that the Constitution grants\\nthe States freer rein than Congress to decide how Section 3\\nshould be enforced with respect to federal offices is simply\\nimplausible.\\n    Finally, state enforcement of Section 3 with respect to the\\nPresidency would raise heightened concerns. \\u201c[I]n the con-\\ntext of a Presidential election, state-imposed restrictions\\nimplicate a uniquely important national interest.\\u201d Ander-\\nson v. Celebrezze, \\n\\n460 U. S. 780\\n\\n, 794\\u2013795 (1983) (footnote\\nomitted). But state-by-state resolution of the question\\nwhether Section 3 bars a particular candidate for President\\nfrom serving would be quite unlikely to yield a uniform an-\\nswer consistent with the basic principle that \\u201cthe President\\n. . . represent[s] all the voters in the Nation.\\u201d \\n\\nId., at 795\\n\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n    Conflicting state outcomes concerning the same candi-\\ndate could result not just from differing views of the merits,\\nbut from variations in state law governing the proceedings\\nthat are necessary to make Section 3 disqualification deter-\\nminations. Some States might allow a Section 3 challenge\\nto succeed based on a preponderance of the evidence, while\\n\\f12                  TRUMP v. ANDERSON\\n\\n                          Per Curiam\\n\\nothers might require a heightened showing. Certain evi-\\ndence (like the congressional Report on which the lower\\ncourts relied here) might be admissible in some States but\\ninadmissible hearsay in others. Disqualification might be\\npossible only through criminal prosecution, as opposed to\\nexpedited civil proceedings, in particular States. Indeed, in\\nsome States\\u2014unlike Colorado (or Maine, where the secre-\\ntary of state recently issued an order excluding former Pres-\\nident Trump from the primary ballot)\\u2014procedures for ex-\\ncluding an ineligible candidate from the ballot may not\\nexist at all. The result could well be that a single candidate\\nwould be declared ineligible in some States, but not others,\\nbased on the same conduct (and perhaps even the same fac-\\ntual record).\\n   The \\u201cpatchwork\\u201d that would likely result from state en-\\nforcement would \\u201csever the direct link that the Framers\\nfound so critical between the National Government and the\\npeople of the United States\\u201d as a whole. U. S. Term Limits,\\n\\n514 U. S., at 822\\n\\n. But in a Presidential election \\u201cthe impact\\nof the votes cast in each State is affected by the votes cast\\u201d\\u2014\\nor, in this case, the votes not allowed to be cast\\u2014\\u201cfor the\\nvarious candidates in other States.\\u201d Anderson, \\n\\n460 U.

L. No. 104-208, Div. C., Title I, \\u00a7 102(a), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 554 (1996), and it specifically identified the border near San Diego, California, as one such area, id. \\u00a7 102(b). Moreover, in order to facilitate swift construction of these new border barriers, Congress authorized the Attorney General of the United States to waive otherwise-applicable provisions of two environmental statutes\\u2014the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (\\u201cESA\\u201d), 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1531\\u201344, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\\u201cNEPA\\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 4321\\u20134370m-12\\u2014to the extent \\u201cnecessary[,]\\u201d as determined by the Attorney General. Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C., Title I, \\u00a7 102(c), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 554 (1996). Significantly for present purposes, in the 23 years that have transpired since the initial passage of the IIRIRA, Congress has amended the statute not only to identify additional priority areas for construction, see Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, \\u00a7 3, 120 Stat. 2638, 2638\\u201339 (2006); Dep't of Homeland Sec. Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, \\u00a7 564, 121 Stat. 1844, 2090\\u201391 (2008), but also to expand the waiver authority to include all laws (not just the two environmental statutes), and to limit significantly the jurisdiction of the federal courts to adjudicate challenges to waivers that are issued pursuant to the IIRIRA's rapid-construction mandate, see REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, Title I, \\u00a7 102, 119 Stat. 231, 306 (2005).\\nThe scope of the IIRIRA's waiver authorization and this Court's ability to consider legal actions that contest the government's waiver of environmental laws to speed the construction of border barriers are the core legal issues in the instant case. On January 22, 2018, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\\u201cDHS\\u201d) announced that DHS was invoking the IIRIRA to waive the application of 25 laws with respect to the construction of physical barriers along a 20-mile stretch of the border in New Mexico (hereinafter \\u201cthe New Mexico Waiver\\u201d). See Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the IIRIRA, as Amended, 83 Fed. Reg. 3,012, 3,013\\u201314 (Jan. 22, 2018). Plaintiffs Center for Biological Diversity, Southwest Environmental Center, Defenders of Wildlife, and Animal Legal Defense Fund (\\u201cPlaintiffs\\u201d) have brought the instant action to contest the DHS Secretary's waiver decision; they claim, primarily, that the Secretary's waiver determination is ultra vires and unlawful \\u201cbecause it exceeds the limited grant of authority for such waivers contained in IIRIRA Section 102,\\u201d (Compl., ECF No. 1, \\u00b6 2), and that the New Mexico Waiver \\u201cwill have numerous negative impacts on the wildlife, plants, and the sensitive biological habitats on and near the proposed\\u201d project site (id. \\u00b6 60). Plaintiffs also insist that the IIRIRA's waiver authority is unconstitutional in various ways. (See id. \\u00b6 2 (\\u201c[A]ny interpretation of [IIRIRA] Section 102 that would sanction the issuance of the New Mexico Waiver would render this statutory provision so broad and unbounded in scope that it would run afoul of the [c]onstitutional principles of Separation of Powers, the Non-Delegation Doctrine, the Presentment Clause and other constitutional provisions.\\u201d).)\\nBefore this Court at present are two dispositive cross-motions that the parties *225 in this matter have filed. Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment on their ultra vires and constitutional claims, and DHS has moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims or, in the alternative, request summary judgment. (See Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\\u201cPls.' Mot.\\u201d), ECF No. 16; Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss & Alternatively Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (\\u201cDefs.' Mot.\\u201d), ECF No. 21.) DHS maintains, as a threshold matter, that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the New Mexico Waiver is ultra vires, because \\u201cCongress has expressly withdrawn district court jurisdiction to review non-constitutional challenges to the [DHS] Secretary's exercise of waiver authority[.]\\u201d (Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. & Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. (\\u201cDefs.' Mem.\\u201d), ECF No. 21-1, at 21.)1 In addition, DHS asserts that Plaintiffs' claims are meritless, because the Secretary has not exceeded the agency's statutory authority in issuing the New Mexico Waiver (see id. at 26\\u201342), and because the IIRIRA's grant of waiver authority is not so broad as to violate the Constitution (see id. at 42\\u201350). Plaintiffs respond that the Court has jurisdiction to hear their ultra vires claims despite the statutory restrictions on judicial review because the New Mexico Waiver was not properly issued pursuant to the IIRIRA (see Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Pls.' Mot. (\\u201cPls.' Mem.\\u201d), ECF No. 16-1, at 42\\u201345), and they further maintain that they are entitled to summary judgment with respect to their ultra vires and constitutional claims (see id. at 26\\u201342, 45\\u201354).\\nFor the reasons explained fully below, this Court concludes that Congress has unambiguously precluded all non-constitutional legal challenges to the exercise of the DHS Secretary's waiver authority, including ultra vires claims. Adding a belt to these suspenders, Congress has further removed this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over any non-constitutional waiver challenges; therefore, this Court is without power to address the merits of Plaintiffs' ultra vires contentions. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims cannot proceed, based on the reasoning of a persuasive prior opinion from this district that addresses the constitutionality of the IIRIRA's section 102(c) waiver authority in substantially similar circumstances and holds that Congress has provided sufficient limitations to the agency's exercise of power to comport with the Constitution's separation-of-powers requirements. Consequently, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be DENIED, and Defendants' cross-motion will be GRANTED, insofar as both the ultra vires and the constitutional claims will be dismissed. A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\\nI. BACKGROUND\\nA. Section 102 Of The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\\nCongress enacted the IIRIRA in 1996, seeking to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (\\u201cINA\\u201d). As described in the Conference Report, the purpose of the IIRIRA was\\n\\n    to improve deterrence of illegal immigration to the United States by increasing border patrol and investigative personnel, by increasing penalties for alien smuggling and for document fraud, by reforming exclusion and deportation law and procedures, by improving the verification system for eligibility for employment, and through other measures, to reform the legal immigration system *226 and facilitate legal entries into the United States, and for other purposes[.]\\n\\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 1. The IIRIRA \\u201cmarked one of the most significant reforms to immigration since the [INA],\\u201d Marshal Garbus, Environmental Impact of Border Security Infrastructure: How Department of Homeland Security's Waiver of Environmental Regulations Threatens Environmental Interests Along the U.S.-Mexico Border, 31 Tul. Envtl. L.J. 327, 334 (2018), and it was developed in the midst of a \\u201cpolitical shift to increase border security during the Clinton administration's Southwest Border Strategy, which made control of unauthorized immigration a top priority[,]\\u201d id. at 335. Leading up to the enactment of the IIRIRA, a measure known as \\u201cOperation Gatekeeper was the Clinton administration's initiative to control unauthorized immigration along the San Diego/Tijuana border, which had been one of the highest traffic locations for unauthorized border crossings.\\u201d Id.2\\n1. Congress commands construction of physical barriers in \\u201careas of high illegal entry into the United States\\u201d\\nAs originally enacted, section 102(a) of the IIRIRA provided that the Attorney General \\u201cshall take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\\u201d Pub. L. No. 104\\u2013208, Div. C., Title I, \\u00a7 102(a), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 554 (1996) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1103 note).3 The statute itself did not delineate what qualifies as an \\u201carea[ ] of high illegal entry,\\u201d except insofar as section 102(b) provided specifically for \\u201cconstruction of fencing and road improvements in the border area near San Diego, California,\\u201d id. \\u00a7 102(b) (capitalization altered).4\\nIn section 102(b) of the IIRIRA, which is presently entitled \\u201cConstruction of fencing and road improvements along the border,\\u201d Congress proceeded beyond section 102(a)'s broad grant of discretion to the Executive Branch with respect to border construction, to specify certain geographical areas along the southwest border where \\u201c[a]dditional fencing\\u201d must be built, and in this regard, it designated particular stretches of land as \\u201c[p]riority areas[.]\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(A), (B). Congress initially pinpointed a 14-mile stretch of the international land border near San Diego, California, \\u201cstarting at the Pacific Ocean and extending eastward,\\u201d and mandated construction \\u201cof second and third fences, in addition to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads between the fences.\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(b)(1) (1996) (\\u201cConstruction of Fencing and Road Improvements in the Border Area Near San Diego, California\\u201d). In 2006, Congress amended section 102(b)(1) to identify five areas along the southern border (no longer including the 14-mile stretch that section 102(b) had previously addressed), and specifically required *227 the DHS Secretary to \\u201cprovide for at least 2 layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors\\u201d in those five areas. Id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(A) (2006).5\\nCongress amended section 102(b)(1)(A) again in 2008; it eliminated the specified list of geographical areas and replaced that language with the following statement: \\u201cIn carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(A). However, Congress remained silent with respect to how or why the Secretary was to select \\u201cnot less than 700 miles\\u201d for fencing along the southwest border. See, e.g., Michael John Garcia, Cong. Research Serv., R43975, Barriers Along the U.S. Borders: Key Authorities and Requirements, at 11\\u201312 (2016).\\nAs mentioned previously, through its various amendments to the IIRIRA's section 102, Congress has consistently and unequivocally established that, with respect to the creation of physical barriers and roads, certain spots along the southern border are \\u201c[p]riority areas.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(B). In 2006, section 102(b)(1)(B) provided specific deadlines for the construction of such barriers in two of the five geographic areas that Congress identified. See id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(B) (2006). Most recently, in 2008, Congress amended the \\u201c[p]riority areas\\u201d provision\\u2014section 102(b)(1)(B)\\u2014to require the Secretary of DHS to \\u201cidentify the 370 miles, or other mileage determined by the Secretary ... along the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective in deterring smugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the United States[.]\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(B)(i).6 The statute further specifies that this \\u201cauthority ... shall expire on December 31, 2008,\\u201d id., and that fencing along those 370 (or other) miles must be completed \\u201cnot later than December 31, 2008,\\u201d id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(B)(ii). The 2008 amendments also added a new provision to section 102(b)(1) that required DHS to \\u201cconsult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, States, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners in the United States to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, and quality of life for the communities and residents located near the sites at which such fencing is to be constructed.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(C)(i).\\n*228 2. Congress permits waiver of laws that impede construction of border barriers, and limits federal litigation concerning such waivers\\nNotably, in addition to requiring the construction of physical barriers and roads in highly trafficked areas of the border, Congress also cleared the way for swift execution of the IIRIRA's section 102 border-barrier mandate. At the time the IIRIRA was enacted, certain environmental statutes were chief among the legal impediments to the rapid construction of the physical barriers and roads that the statute prescribed\\u2014specifically, the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act7 \\u2014 and Congress expressly addressed its concerns about the delay that enforcement of such environmental mandates might engender in the text of the IIRIRA itself, by authorizing the waiver of the requirements that these two statutes impose. When enacted in 1996, section 102(c) stated: \\u201c[t]he provisions of the [ESA] and the [NEPA] are waived to the extent the Attorney General deems necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c) (1996).\\nBy 2005, it had become clear that, \\u201c[d]espite the existing waiver provision, construction of the San Diego barriers has been delayed due to a dispute involving other laws.\\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 109-72 (Conf. Rep.), at 171 (2005). Consequently, Congress amended the IIRIRA's waiver provision to permit the DHS Secretary to waive all legal requirements that can impede expeditious construction of border barriers, see IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1); see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 171 (explaining that \\u201c[c]ontinued delays caused by litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with respect to other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security infrastructure along the border[,]\\u201d and noting that Congress decided to authorize the waiver of \\u201call laws\\u201d rather than \\u201call legal requirements\\u201d in order to \\u201cclarify[ ] [its] intent that the Secretary's discretionary waiver authority extends to any local, state[,] or federal statute, regulation, or administrative order that could impede expeditious construction of border security infrastructure\\u201d). Thus, section 102(c) now specifies that\\n\\n    [n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section. Any such decision by the Secretary shall be effective upon being published in the Federal Register.\\n\\nIIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1).\\nFinally, and significantly for present purposes, Congress also specifically addressed\\u2014and significantly restricted\\u2014the scope of the federal courts' authority to review legal challenges that arise from DHS's implementation of the IIRIRA's waiver provision. This change occurred as part of the package of amendments that expanded the DHS Secretary's waiver authority in the manner described above. In *229 its entirety, the provision of the IIRIRA's section 102(c) that addresses federal court review states:\\n(2) Federal court review.\\u2014\\n(A) In general.\\u2014The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph 1 [i.e., the waiver provision]. A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\\n(B) Time for filing of complaint.\\u2014Any cause or claim brought pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the action or decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security. A claim shall be barred unless it is filed within the time specified.\\n(C) Ability to seek appellate review.\\u2014An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\\nId. \\u00a7 102(c)(2).\\nPer the above-quoted statutory language, any legal action challenging an act of or determination by the DHS Secretary with respect to the waiver of legal requirements in order to facilitate the construction of physical barriers along the border pursuant to subsection 102(c)(1) must allege a constitutional violation, and has to be filed in federal district court within 60 days of the Secretary's notice of such waiver. See id. \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A), (B). In addition, the federal district court (which has exclusive jurisdiction to hear any such claims) can entertain such a challenge only if the claim alleges a violation of the Constitution. See id. \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A). Furthermore, the Supreme Court is the only tribunal vested with the authority to review any such district court determination. See id. \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(C). In this way, Congress has made crystal clear that it intends \\u201cto ensure that judicial review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary's waiver.\\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 172.\\nB. Facts Pertaining To The Instant Challenge\\nPrior to 2017, the Secretary of DHS had issued waivers pursuant to section 102(c) of the IIRIRA on just five occasions. (See Pls.' Mem. at 20; Defs.' Mem. at 16.)8 Each of these waivers related to one of the construction projects that Congress had specifically delineated in section 102(b). (See Pls.' Mem. at 36 & n.32.) Then, on January 25, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,767\\u2014entitled \\u201cBorder Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\\u201d\\u2014which, among other things, ordered the DHS Secretary to \\u201ctake all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border[.]\\u201d *230 82 Fed. Reg. 8,793, 8,794 (Jan. 25, 2017). According to that executive order, the \\u201cwall\\u201d must be \\u201ca contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.\\u201d Id. Pursuant to this mandate, in August and September of 2017, the DHS Secretary issued two waivers under the IIRIRA's section 102(c). See 82 Fed. Reg. 35,984, 35,984\\u201385 (Aug. 2, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg. 42,829, 42,829\\u201331 (Sept. 12, 2017).9\\nAs relevant here, on January 22, 2018, DHS published in the Federal Register the Secretary's determination that a specified 20-mile stretch of border in New Mexico qualifies as \\u201can area of high illegal entry\\u201d under section 102(a) of the IIRIRA; that \\u201c[t]here is presently a need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States to deter illegal crossings in the project area\\u201d; and that waiver of 25 statutes \\u201cin their entirety,\\u201d including the ESA and the NEPA, is \\u201cnecessary\\u201d to \\u201censure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads in the project area[.]\\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 3,012, 3,013 (Jan. 22, 2018). According to Plaintiffs, the project area that is the subject of the New Mexico Waiver \\u201cis located in the middle of the internationally-renowned Chihuahuan Desert, considered to be one of the world's most biologically diverse deserts due to the presence and abundance of endemic species that exist nowhere else on earth.\\u201d (Pls.' Mem. at 23.) Plaintiffs also maintain that, in additional to several detrimental non-environmental impacts, \\u201c[t]he New Mexico Border Wall Project will result in numerous negative impacts on the wildlife, vegetation, and the sensitive biological habitats on and near the proposed Project site.\\u201d (Id.; see also id. at 23\\u201325.)\\nDHS announced the commencement of its work on the New Mexico Border Wall Project on April 9, 2018.10 In a press release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection clarified that, \\u201c[a]s part of the President's Executive Order 13767, and at the direction of the Department of Homeland Secretary, construction for a border wall replacement in Santa Teresa with new bollard style wall will begin on Monday, April 9[,]\\u201d and that \\u201c[c]onstruction is slated to run for approximately 390 days.\\u201d11 During the motions hearing this Court held in December of 2018, Defendants' counsel indicated that the New Mexico Border Wall Project's \\u201cbarrier installation\\u201d was completed in October of 2018, and that \\u201cthe accompanying road\\u201d was \\u201cexpected to be completed in January [of 2019].\\u201d (Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 32, at 56:9\\u201311.)12 DHS also presently asserts that the agency consulted with \\u201crepresentatives from the Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish & Wildlife *231 Service [(\\u2018USFWS\\u2019)], and Bureau of Land Management [(\\u2018BLM\\u2019)]\\u201d prior to the DHS Secretary's determination that the New Mexico Waiver should be issued (Defs.' Mem. at 18), and that before the April 2008 commencement of construction, DHS consulted with \\u201crelevant Native American tribes and the New Mexico State Historic Preservation Officer[,]\\u201d as well as \\u201ctwo New Mexico state agencies, the local county manager, USFWS, BLM, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\\u201d (id.).\\nC. Procedural History\\nPlaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit on March 22, 2018 (see Compl.), claiming that the DHS Secretary's invocation of waiver authority under the IIRIRA's section 102(c) with respect to the New Mexico Border Wall Project was ultra vires and therefore unlawful (see id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 64\\u201372 (Count One); id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 73\\u201380 (Count Two)), and that the New Mexico Waiver violates three provisions of the Constitution of the United States: the Take Care Clause (see id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 81\\u201385 (Count Three)); the Non-Delegation and Separation of Powers Doctrine (see id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 86\\u201394 (Count Four)); and the Presentment Clause (see id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 95\\u2013100 (Count Five)). Plaintiffs' complaint claims that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to issue the New Mexico Waiver\\u2014i.e., that the Secretary acted in an ultra vires manner\\u2014because, in Plaintiffs' view, section 102(c)'s waiver authority \\u201cis limited to the specific border barriers and roads [that Congress] required to be constructed pursuant to IIRIRA Section 102(b)\\u201d (id. \\u00b6 67 (emphasis added)), yet DHS had already fulfilled section 102(b)'s construction requirements at the time that the New Mexico Waiver was issued (see id. \\u00b6 70). Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that the Secretary impermissibly transcended the agency's statutory authority because DHS \\u201cfailed to conduct necessary prerequisites for exercising the waiver authority for expedited construction as set forth in provision IIRIRA Section 102(b)(1)(C).\\u201d (Id. \\u00b6 74.)\\nPlaintiffs' complaint further claims that, by issuing the New Mexico Waiver, DHS has violated the Constitution's venerated separation-of-powers principles. First, insofar as the DHS Secretary's issuance of the New Mexico Waiver \\u201cfailed to comply with the requirements and limitations of IIRIRA Section 102\\u201d (id. \\u00b6 85), Plaintiffs maintain that the decision to issue the waiver violated the Take Care Clause of the United States Constitution, which requires that the Executive Branch \\u201c \\u2018shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed[.]\\u2019 \\u201d (Id. \\u00b6 83 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \\u00a7 3).) Second, Plaintiffs assert that the IIRIRA's section 102(c) itself transgresses the constitutional non-delegation doctrine, because the statute \\u201cdelegates to the Executive Branch, namely the DHS Secretary, the legislative power to waive the application of any Congressionally-enacted law to construction on the U.S.-Mexico border\\u201d without \\u201can intelligible general policy to guide [the Secretary's] decision-making.\\u201d (Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 92, 93.) Third, and finally, Plaintiffs argue that the IIRIRA's section 102(c) violates the Presentment Clause, both on its face and as applied to the circumstances of the instant case, because the statute impermissibly \\u201cvests unilateral power in the DHS Secretary to waive the application of any laws in areas along the border for purposes of building border walls without Congress passing a law to void the specific laws at issue or limit their application, and presenting it to the President\\u201d (id. \\u00b6 98), and because, with respect to the New Mexico Border Wall Project in particular, the Secretary \\u201cchose which laws to waive and which laws to obey, without an act of Congress specifying which particular law or set of laws could be waived and without the presentation of *232 said Congressional act to the President\\u201d (id. \\u00b6 99).13\\nIn addition to the complaint, Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for summary judgment that restates and reinforces the assertions that are made in their pleading. (See Pls.' Mot. (filed on May 10, 2018); Pls.' Mem.) Defendants responded, on June 15, 2018, by filing a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. (See Defs.' Mot.). In their motion, Defendants argue, as a threshold matter, that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the New Mexico Waiver is ultra vires, as Plaintiffs claim, because \\u201cCongress has expressly withdrawn district court jurisdiction to review non-constitutional challenges to the Secretary's exercise of waiver authority[.]\\u201d (Defs.' Mem. at 21; see also id. (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A)); id. at 19\\u201326). Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs' ultra vires claims fail as a matter of law. (See, e.g., id. at 27 (asserting Plaintiffs have not \\u201cidentif[ied] a \\u2018statutory right\\u2019 by which Plaintiffs are entitled to vindication[,]\\u201d as valid ultra vires claims allegedly require); see also id. at 28\\u201342 (arguing that DHS did not violate any statutory prohibition or requirement when it issued the New Mexico Waiver). Defendants further insist that the IIRIRA's section 102(c) and the New Mexico Waiver comport with the Constitution. (See id. at 42\\u201350.) This Court held a motions hearing on the parties' cross-motions on December 18, 2018. (See Min. Entry of Dec. 18, 2018.) During the hearing, Defendants represented, for the first time, that \\u201cthe Department of Homeland Security and [the DHS Secretary] had relied on both section 102(a) and 102(b) of the IIRIRA when issuing the waiver at issue in this case\\u201d (Min. Order of Dec. 19, 2018 (emphasis added)), and the Court subsequently ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs (at Plaintiffs' request) to address the potential implications of this new revelation on the parties' arguments (see id.). After the hearing, the Court also acted to consolidate another matter\\u2014Center for Biological Diversity v. Nielsen, No. 18-cv-2396\\u2014with the instant case. (See Min. Order of Jan. 9, 2019; see also Resp. to Order to Show Cause, 18-cv-2396, ECF No. 9, at 1 (agreeing that the Court \\u201cshould consolidate\\u201d the two cases because they \\u201cinvolve many of the same parties and both challenge [the DHS Secretary's] invocation of Section 102 of [the IIRIRA] to waive dozens of laws that would otherwise apply to the construction of border wall projects\\u201d (footnotes omitted)).)14\\nThe parties filed the aforementioned supplemental briefs by February 28, 2019. *233 (See ECF Nos. 31, 33, 34.) Thus, the parties' cross-motions are now ripe for this Court's review.\\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\\nA. Cross-Motions For Summary Judgment In Cases Involving Ultra Vires Claims And Constitutional Challenges To Agency Action\\n1\\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 requires a court to grant summary judgment \\u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). However, in cases challenging agency action, \\u201c[t]he entire case on review is [ordinarily] a question of law, and only a question of law[,]\\u201d Marshall Cty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993), and, therefore, the summary judgment standard functions slightly differently. Cf. Henry v. Sec'y of Treasury, 266 F. Supp. 3d 80, 86 (D.D.C. 2017) (explaining that, in the context of the APA, \\u201cthe reviewing court generally ... reviews the [agency's] decision as an appellate court addressing issues of law\\u201d).\\n2\\nNotably, \\u201cin the context of ultra vires and constitutional separation of powers claims, there are no questions of fact, because whether or not a statute or the Constitution grants the [Executive Branch] the power to act in a certain way is a pure question of law.\\u201d Am. Fed. of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, 318 F. Supp. 3d 370, 394 (D.D.C. 2018), rev'd on other grounds, 929 F.3d 748 (D.C. Cir. 2019); see also, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1332\\u201339 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (conducting de novo review). \\u201cThe same can be said of any questions of interpretation that a federal court may have to answer in parsing out the meaning of any relevant statutes[.]\\u201d Am. Fed. of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 394.\\nB. Defense Motions Styled As \\u201cMotions To Dismiss, Or, In The Alternative, For Summary Judgment\\u201d\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nWhen a defendant moves for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 as an alternative to dismissal under Rule 12 (see, e.g., Defs.' Mem. at 50 (\\u201cPlaintiffs' claims should be dismissed as a matter of law or, in the alternative, the Court should ... grant summary judgment to Defendants\\u201d)), \\u201cthe decision regarding whether or not to treat a motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court[,] which means that this Court need not necessarily accede to [the defendants'] request regarding how its motion should be evaluated.\\u201d Ross v. U.S. Capitol Police, 195 F. Supp. 3d 180, 192 (D.D.C. 2016) (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where, as here, a defendant maintains that the case should be terminated either because the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Rule 56, or because the pleadings are insufficient to state a claim or to establish the court's jurisdiction under Rule 12, the court may review the parties' arguments with respect to both of those grounds to determine the extent to which the motion can be sustained. See, e.g., Smith v. United States, 121 F. Supp. 3d 112, 119\\u201326 (D.D.C. 2015) (evaluating certain arguments under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and others under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, where defendants' motion sought either dismissal for failure to state a claim or summary judgment). However, because such a motion presents these alleged defects as alternative bases for terminating the action, the *234 court may also opt to evaluate one basis for termination of the action and not the other. See, e.g., Jones v. Nat'l Council on Disability, 66 F. Supp. 3d 94, 104 n.8 (D.D.C. 2014); ViroPharma, Inc. v. Hamburg, 916 F. Supp. 2d 76, 77, 83 (D.D.C. 2013); cf. PDK Labs., Inc. v. DEA, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring) (stating where there \\u201cis a sufficient ground for deciding th[e] case ..., the cardinal principle of judicial restraint\\u2014if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more\\u2014counsels us to go no further\\u201d).\\n6\\n7\\nNotably, here, Defendants have maintained that summary judgment in their favor is warranted as an alternative to their argument that Plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed prior to judgment, pursuant to either Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6). A defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and once such a motion has been filed, it is the plaintiff's burden to establish the court's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. See Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Exp.\\u2013Imp. Bank of U.S., 85 F. Supp. 3d 250, 259 (D.D.C. 2015). \\u201c[I]f the plaintiff fails to do so, the court must dismiss the complaint[.]\\u201d Ross, 195 F. Supp. 3d at 191.\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nWhen considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), a court must \\u201ctreat the complaint's factual allegations as true\\u201d and \\u201cgrant plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\\u201d Delta Air Lines, 85 F. Supp. 3d at 259 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). However, the \\u201cfactual allegations in the complaint\\u201d receive \\u201ccloser scrutiny in resolving a 12(b)(1) motion than in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.\\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, unlike in the Rule 12(b)(6) context, the Court \\u201cmay consider materials outside the pleadings\\u201d in resolving the Rule 12(b)(1) question. Id.

P. 12(b)(6).

In this regard, the \\u201c \\u2018court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint[,]\\u2019 \\u201d but need not do the same for legal conclusions. Harris, 791 F.3d at 68 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937). \\u201cAccordingly, \\u2018threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice\\u2019 \\u201d to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1357 (3d ed. 2015)). And in contrast to a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(1), a *235 court assessing whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, as well as any \\u201cdocuments attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, or documents upon which the plaintiff's complaint necessarily relies[.]\\u201d Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 275 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\\nIII. ANALYSIS\\nPlaintiffs have brought two ultra vires claims (the first and second claims for relief) and three constitutional claims (the third, fourth, and fifth claims for relief), each of which challenges DHS's issuance of the New Mexico Waiver, as explained above. For the reasons laid out below, this Court finds that Congress has expressly precluded judicial review of non-constitutional claims that arise from DHS's exercise of the IIRIRA's section 102(c) waiver authority, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that are sufficient to sustain their constitutional claims as a matter of law. Thus, Plaintiffs' entire complaint must be DISMISSED.\\nA. Plaintiffs' Ultra Vires Claims Cannot Be Adjudicated In Federal Court\\n17\\nPlaintiffs' primary contention is that, \\u201c[b]ecause the scope of the IIRIRA Section 102(c) waiver provision is limited to the border barriers and road requirements specified by IIRIRA Section 102(b), the requirements of which have already been fulfilled, the purported waiver of ... laws under the New Mexico Waiver is an unlawful ultra vires act.\\u201d (Compl. \\u00b6 71.) In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that, \\u201cby approving the waiver prior to completing at least the prerequisite consultation mandated in Section 102(b)(1)(C),\\u201d the DHS Secretary's \\u201cdecision to issue the New Mexico Waiver facially violates the requirements under IIRIRA Section 102 and is thus ultra vires because it is in excess of the Secretary's delegated powers[.]\\u201d (Id. \\u00b6 80.) Plaintiffs insist that these are legal claims that this Court can, and must, adjudicate, given the \\u201c \\u2018strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action[.]\\u2019 \\u201d (Pls.'

But, unfortunately for Plaintiffs, the language of section 102(c)(2)(A) plainly evidences Congress's intent to preclude non-constitutional causes of action that assail a DHS section 102(c) waiver determination, and Congress has also expressly deprived the federal courts of jurisdiction over non-constitutional claims that challenge DHS's section 102(c) waiver decisions. Thus, Congress has made it abundantly clear that Plaintiffs' ultra vires claims cannot proceed in federal court.\\n1. While judicial review of allegedly lawless agency action is ordinarily presumed, clear indicia of congressional intent can overcome that presumption\\n18\\n19\\n20\\nCourts have long recognized that an aggrieved party can sue in federal court to challenge agency action as ultra vires, even when a statute does not specifically delineate that right.

See, e.g., Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. USPS, 321 F.3d 1166, 1172\\u201373 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Railway Labor Execs.' Ass'n v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 29 F.3d 655, 662\\u201363 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

United States, 848 F.2d 217, 221 (D.C.

In other words, even when \\u201cCongress ha[s] expressed an unqualified intent to shut off review,\\u201d an exception may still exist \\u201con grounds that the legislature would not be deemed to have barred judicial comparison of agency action with plain statutory commands unless such a ban was clearly articulated.\\u201d Dart, 848 F.2d at 222 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\nOf course, the devil is in the details: each case involves a statute that must be interpreted to evaluate the degree to which, via the express preclusion of jurisdiction or otherwise, Congress also intended to bar even plausible claims of ultra vires agency action. No less an authority than the United States Supreme Court has reminded lower courts that \\u201c[t]he presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is just that\\u2014a presumption[,]\\u201d Block v. Cmty.

See Block, 467 U.S. at 349, 104 S.Ct. 2450 (explaining that the strong presumption in favor of judicial review \\u201cmay be overcome by specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent\\u201d). Such congressional intent \\u201cmay also be inferred from contemporaneous judicial construction barring review and the congressional acquiescence in it, ... from the collective import of legislative and judicial history behind a particular statute, ... *237 [or] from the statutory scheme as a whole.\\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\\n25\\n26\\n27\\nAs a practical matter, this all means that federal courts \\u201cwill normally disregard \\u2018basically lawless\\u2019 agency action only when clearly instructed to do so.\\u201d Ralpho v.

Thus, in the face of clear statutory language and other indisputable indicia of Congress's intent to prevent federal courts from reviewing even ultra vires agency action, it is not enough for a plaintiff to point to a statute that governs agency conduct and to argue merely that Congress must have intended for its provisions to be judicially enforced. As the D.C. Circuit has long recognized, the mere fact \\u201c[t]hat Congress has imposed strictures [on agencies] does not, of course, prevent it from shielding even the most patent deviation from the statutory scheme from judicial redress where the Constitution is in no wise implicated.\\u201d Ralpho, 569 F.2d at 622 (citing Switchmen's Union v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 320 U.S. 297, 301, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61 (1943)).\\n2. Section 102(c)(2) of the IIRIRA strips federal district courts of the power to review any and all non-constitutional claims that arise from the Secretary's exercise of section 102(c)'s waiver authority\\nWith respect to Plaintiffs' ability to bring, and this Court's power to consider, the ultra vires claims at issue here, the Court need look no further than the \\u201cspecific language[,]\\u201d Block, 467 U.S. at 349, 104 S.Ct. 2450, of the IIRIRA, and, in particular, the text of section 102(c)(2)(A). For the following reasons, this statutory provision plainly compels the conclusion that there is both a cause-of-action restriction and a jurisdictional bar with respect to this Court's consideration of non-constitutional challenges to the DHS Secretary's actions undertaken pursuant to section 102(c)(1), including the ultra vires claims that Plaintiffs are asserting. Cf. Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917) (\\u201cIt is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, and if the law is within the constitutional authority of the lawmaking body which passed it, the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\\u201d (citations omitted)); United States v. Cordova, 806 F.3d 1085, 1098 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\\u201cAs always, we begin with the text of the statute.\\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The full text of section 102(c)(2)(A) of the IIRIRA reads as follows:\\n\\n    [t]he district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all causes or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to [section 102(c)(1)]. A cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\\n\\nIIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A).16 By its plain terms, this statutory provision applies to *238 the instant circumstances. First of all, all of Plaintiffs' claims unquestionably \\u201caris[e] from an[ ] action undertaken, or a[ ] decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to [section 102(c)(1)][,]\\u201d id., which is section 102's waiver provision (see, e.g., Compl. \\u00b6 1 (\\u201cIn this action, Plaintiffs ... challenge the issuance of a waiver on January 22, 2018 by [the DHS Secretary] ... that purports to exempt construction of approximately twenty miles of border walls and associated infrastructure in southern New Mexico [ ] from compliance with the [NEPA], the [ESA], and numerous other statutory requirements.\\u201d); id. \\u00b6 2 (\\u201cIn issuing the New Mexico Waiver, Secretary Niels[e]n invoked the authority purportedly contained in Section 102 of [IIRIRA].... [T]he New Mexico Waiver is ultra vires and unlawful because it exceeds the limited grant of authority for such waivers contained in IIRIRA Section 102.\\u201d); id. \\u00b6 4 (\\u201c[B]ecause the New Mexico Border Wall Project does not fall within the scope of projects mandated by Section 102, ... the waiver authority under Section 102(c) is inapplicable to the New Mexico Border Wall Project.\\u201d)). This means that, per the language of section 102(c)(2)(A), \\u201c[t]he district courts of the United States ... have exclusive jurisdiction to hear\\u201d Plaintiffs' claims. IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(C)(2)(A).\\nNext, the IIRIRA expressly addresses both the ability of a plaintiff to bring a cause of action or claim concerning the Secretary's exercise of that waiver authority and the power of the federal district courts to review any such claims\\u2014and it restricts both, in no uncertain terms. In rapid succession, section 102(c)(2)(A) provides that \\u201c[a] cause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States[,]\\u201d id. (emphasis added), and then states that \\u201c[t]he court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph[,]\\u201d id. (emphasis added). Thus, Congress has not only expressly restricted a plaintiff's right to bring any non-constitutional claim that challenges a DHS waiver determination, but has also limited a court's authority to consider any challenge other than those alleging constitutional violations. Indeed, the plain language of the statute leaves no doubt that, except for review of alleged violations of the Constitution, Congress intended to preclude completely judicial review of agency actions taken, or decisions made, pursuant to section 102's waiver provision, including the contention that a particular waiver decision is not authorized by statute. See In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir. 2019) (explaining that the jurisdictional bar applies to ultra vires claims that challenge DHS waivers on the grounds that \\u201cthe waivers themselves were not authorized by the Secretary's authority under section 102(c)(1)\\u201d); (see also Compl. \\u00b6 72 (asserting that the DHS Secretary's \\u201cpurported waiver of laws under the New Mexico Waiver is an unlawful ultra vires act\\u201d because \\u201cthe New Mexico Border Wall Project is not subject to the scope of the IIRIRA Section 102(c) waiver authority\\u201d).)\\nGiven the abundantly clear and specific language that Congress used in the IIRIRA's section 102(c)(2)(A), see Block, 467 U.S. at 349, 104 S.Ct. 2450, which plainly blocks non-constitutional claims by precluding such causes of action and also stripping federal courts of the power to consider such claims, it is not necessary for the Court to delve into the IIRIRA's *239 legislative history to determine Congress's intent. See Caminetti, 242 U.S. at 485, 37 S.Ct. 192. But even a cursory review of the IIRIRA's legislative pedigree supports this Court's conclusions.\\nAs mentioned above, the Conference Report pertaining to the 2005 amendments to the IIRIRA's section 102, which added the judicial review provision (see supra Part I.A.2), explains that, despite the Attorney General's then-existing ability to waive the ESA and the NEPA, \\u201c[c]ontinued delays caused by litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with respect to other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security infrastructure along the border[.]\\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 171.17 Therefore, according to the Conference Report, it was the vexing litigation delays that motivated Congress to amend section 102 such that it now authorizes the waiver of \\u201call laws that [the DHS Secretary] determines, in his or her sole discretion, are necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of the border barriers[,]\\u201d and also \\u201cprohibit[s] judicial review of a waiver decision or action by the Secretary[.]\\u201d Id. The Conference Report further states that Congress \\u201cbar[red] judicially ordered compensatory, declaratory, or injunctive, equitable, or any other relief or other remedy for damage alleged to result from any such decision or action[,]\\u201d and \\u201cprovided federal judicial review [only] for claims alleging that the actions or decisions of the Secretary violate the United States Constitution.\\u201d Id. at 171, 172. Thus, Congress's unmistakable \\u201cintent [was] to ensure that judicial review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary's waiver.\\u201d Id. at 172.\\nAccordingly, both the statutory language of section 102(c)(2)(A), which imposes restrictions on judicial review of the DHS Secretary's actions taken pursuant to section 102(c)(1) in two different ways, and the legislative history of the enactment of those restrictions, make crystal clear that Congress intended to eliminate litigation that would \\u201cdelay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure[,]\\u201d to the fullest extent possible, i.e., to the extent constitutionally allowed. Id.\\n3. Plaintiffs' efforts to contradict the clear conclusion that their ultra vires claims cannot proceed are not persuasive\\nFacing an indisputable pattern of congressional actions and statements that clearly and convincingly establish Congress's intent to preclude litigation over the DHS Secretary's waiver authority, Plaintiffs have cleverly crafted an \\u201cunlawful conduct\\u201d loophole in section 102(c)(2)(A)'s text where one does not exist. First, they maintain that \\u201cby its plain terms,\\u201d section 102(c)(2)(A) \\u201csimply precludes statutory review of \\u2018any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the [DHS Secretary] pursuant to [section 102(c)(1)][,]\\u2019 \\u201d and, then, Plaintiffs assert that \\u201cthe [New Mexico Waiver] was not an action lawfully made \\u2018pursuant to\\u2019 the circumspect waiver authority of \\u00a7 102(c)(1).\\u201d (Pls.' Opp'n at 14 (emphasis in original) (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A)); see also Pls.' Mem. at 43 (\\u201cPlaintiffs' claim here is that the New Mexico Waiver was not properly issued \\u2018pursuant to\\u2019 IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1).\\u201d (emphasis in original)).) This reading is designed to persuade the Court that Congress \\u201csimply\\u201d intended to preclude judicial review of legal claims concerning *240 lawful exercises of the DHS Secretary's waiver authority. (See, e.g., Pls.' Opp'n at 14 (asserting that \\u201cthe Waiver was not an action lawfully made \\u2018pursuant to\\u2019 the circumspect waiver authority of \\u00a7 102(c)(1)\\u201d (emphasis in original)).) But the words \\u201clawfully made\\u201d appear nowhere in the relevant statutory text. See IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A) (limiting judicial review of \\u201cany action undertaken, or any decision made ... pursuant to paragraph (1)\\u201d (emphasis added)). And, of course, whether or not the New Mexico Waiver was lawful is precisely the contention that this Court would be required to decide if it does, indeed, have the power to review Plaintiffs' ultra vires claims.\\nThus, Plaintiffs' interpretation of the reach of section 102(c)(2)(A)'s judicial review language assumes the answer to the very question that has to be decided, in a manner that is entirely circular. That is, Plaintiffs repeatedly maintain that because the statute precludes only the exercise of jurisdiction to consider waivers that have been lawfully issued, Congress did not intend to bar the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction to consider whether the New Mexico Waiver is lawful. (See, e.g, Pls.' Mem. at 43 (\\u201cPlaintiffs do not dispute that Congress has limited judicial review of non-constitutional claims regarding a waiver properly issued pursuant to IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1), as articulated in \\u00a7 102(c)(2),\\u201d but \\u201cPlaintiffs' claim here is that the New Mexico Waiver was not properly issued \\u2018pursuant to\\u2019 IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1). Accordingly, the ultra vires claim is not subject to \\u00a7 102(c)(2)'s judicial review restrictions.\\u201d (emphasis in original)).) In other words, Plaintiffs' core contention is that it is the unlawful nature of the DHS Secretary's section 102(c) waiver that allows this Court to proceed to determine the lawfulness of the DHS Secretary's waiver despite the jurisdictional bar, because the jurisdictional bar applies only to challenges to lawful waivers. And Plaintiffs further insist that any other conclusion is \\u201cuntenable\\u201d because \\u201cDHS would not only hold unfettered discretion to take action under \\u00a7 102, but would also have unreviewable discretion to determine that any action it takes falls within the section's delegated authority.\\u201d (Pls.' Mem. at 44\\u201345.)\\nUnfortunately for Plaintiffs, it is their argument, and not a plain reading of section 102(c)(2)(A), that leads to a \\u201ctautological result[.]\\u201d (Id. at 44.) Rather, with respect to the threshold questions of whether Plaintiffs' ultra vires claims are cognizable under the IIRIRA and whether this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' claims, this Court must evaluate Congress's intent in light of the language of the statute. And as explained above, in this Court's view, Congress has made it abundantly clear that claims that challenge the propriety or lawfulness of the Secretary's conduct with respect to the exercise of section 102(c)'s waiver authority will not suffice; only a claim that the DHS waiver at issue is unconstitutional will do. Therefore, plaintiffs cannot press ultra vires claims in federal court, nor do federal courts have jurisdiction to consider such claims, simply and solely because those claims are not constitutional challenges.\\nTo be sure, \\u201c[s]uch a conclusion undermines the \\u2018inherent power of the federal courts to reestablish the [non-constitutional] limits on executive authority through judicial review\\u2019 \\u201d (id. at 45 (quoting Adamski v. McHugh, 304 F. Supp. 3d 227, 237 (D.D.C. 2015))), which makes it entirely understandable that Plaintiffs are reluctant to accept that Congress would have intended to permit a federal agency to flout its statutory directives. But, as noted previously, Congress has this right, so long as \\u201cthe Constitution is in no wise implicated,\\u201d Ralpho, 569 F.2d at 622, and this *241 Court cannot construe the IIRIRA to provide it with review powers that Congress has plainly precluded. In other words, however rational Plaintiffs' concerns may be, such matters must be taken up with Congress. Here, Plaintiffs cannot reasonably assert that Congress must have meant something different than what its statute plainly says.\\n28\\nIt is also clear to this Court that Plaintiffs' reasoning with respect to how the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction is to be evaluated under the instant circumstances cannot be sustained. As noted previously, Plaintiffs' primary contention is, in essence, that Congress intended for section 102(c)(2)(A) to preclude only judicial review of non-meritorious non-constitutional claims regarding DHS waivers\\u2014i.e., that only challenges to lawful waiver determinations by the Secretary are barred. (See Pls. Opp'n at 14; see also Pls. Mem. at 43 (\\u201cPlaintiffs do not dispute that Congress has limited judicial review of non-constitutional claims regarding a waiver properly issued pursuant to IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1)[.]\\u201d (emphasis omitted)).) But whether or not a federal court has the power to consider a plaintiff's claim does not, and cannot, depend upon the court's deciding, as a threshold matter, that the plaintiff's claim is a meritorious one. See Cause of Action Inst. v. IRS, No. 16-cv-2354, 390 F.Supp.3d 84, 97\\u201399, 2019 WL 3225751, at *8\\u20139 (D.D.C. July 17, 2019). This Court recently rejected this same reasoning in a markedly different context, see id., and Plaintiffs' version of that same argument is no more persuasive.\\nPlaintiffs' attempts to distinguish non-meritorious non-constitutional challenges to DHS waivers (i.e., challenges to section 102(c) waivers that were lawfully issued) from those non-constitutional legal claims that have merit (i.e., challenges to section 102(c) waivers that were not lawfully issued) is also flatly inconsistent with the statutory text, insofar as Congress has made no effort whatsoever to suggest that it intended for only non-meritorious non-constitutional claims to be barred by section 102(c)(2)(A). To the contrary, in that provision, Congress states plainly that \\u201conly\\u201d constitutional \\u201ccauses or claims\\u201d are allowed, and that federal courts do have not jurisdiction to determine the merits of any non-constitutional claims, IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added); there is no exception provided for potentially valid ones. Finally, this Court notes that the mechanics of section 102(c)(2)(A) are such that even if the phrase \\u201cpursuant to\\u201d is read to mean \\u201clawfully pursuant to,\\u201d as Plaintiffs argue, that interpretation would, at most, indicate that Plaintiffs' ultra vires claims are viable causes of action\\u2014it says nothing about the distinct issue of this Court's power to consider and resolve such claims. As explained above, section 102(c)(2) not only establishes that the only \\u201ccause[s] of action or \\u201cclaim[s]\\u201d that can be brought to challenge a section 102(c)(1) waiver are those that \\u201calleg[e] a violation of the Constitution of the United States,\\u201d but it also states that \\u201c[t]he court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Congress certainly could have referenced subparagraph (1) with respect to this language, as it did when addressing the viable causes of action or claims\\u2014e.g., by stating that the district courts' jurisdiction does not extend to \\u201ccauses or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to paragraph (1) [section 102(c)(1)][,]\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A)\\u2014and, if it had done so, perhaps Plaintiffs could reasonably contend that its \\u201clawfully pursuant to\\u201d reading applies and permits district courts to retain jurisdiction to address unlawful waivers. But, instead, the last sentence of *242 section 102(c)(2)(A) strips the Court of jurisdiction over \\u201cany claim not specified in this subparagraph[,]\\u201d id., and the sole claims \\u201cspecified in ... subparagraph\\u201d (c)(2) are those that \\u201calleg[e] a violation of the Constitution of the United States[,]\\u201d id. Therefore, even if Plaintiffs were correct that ultra vires causes of action or claims are cognizable where a plaintiff challenges the DHS Secretary's alleged waiver as unlawful, given the language of the statute, this Court still would \\u201cnot have jurisdiction\\u201d to entertain such claims. Id.\\n* * *\\nIn sum, this Court finds that section 102(c)(2)(A) plainly and unequivocally expresses Congress's intent with respect to restricting judicial review of legal challenges to section 102(c)(1) waiver determinations, in a manner that overcomes even the strong presumption that Congress ordinarily intends for agency actions to be subject to review by the federal courts. Consistent with its desire \\u201cto ensure that judicial review ... not delay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure,\\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 172, Congress has drafted section 102(c)(2)(A) to lead inexorably to the conclusion that there is neither a viable cause of action in federal court concerning section 102(c)(1) waiver determinations, nor federal court jurisdiction to review any such challenge, unless the claim alleges a violation of the United States Constitution. Consequently, this Court cannot, and will not, address the merits of Plaintiffs' non-constitutional contentions that the New Mexico Waiver \\u201cexceeds the limited grant of authority for such waivers contained in IIRIRA Section 102[(c)(1)]\\u201d (Compl. \\u00b6 2), or that DHS acted unlawfully because it failed to satisfy the consultation prerequisite set forth in section 102(b)(1)(C) before the New Mexico Waiver issued. Instead, the Court agrees with DHS that, even if Plaintiffs claims were valid, by virtue of section 102(c)(2)(A), these non-constitutional challenges must be dismissed.18\\nB. Plaintiffs Have Failed To State Viable Constitutional Claims\\n29\\nThe IIRIRA's judicial review provision indisputably preserves this Court's *243 authority to review a legal claim that \\u201can[ ] action undertaken, or a[ ] decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security\\u201d with respect to the waiver of legal requirements under section 102(c)(1) violates the Constitution. IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A). Plaintiffs here assert generally that the IIRIRA's section 102(c)(1) waiver authority is \\u201cunconstitutional because it unlawfully vests Congress's lawmaking powers in the Executive Branch\\u201d (Pls.' Mem. at 45), and they maintain, in particular, that if section 102(c)(1) is interpreted to authorize waivers for border construction projects beyond those projects that are specifically delineated in section 102(b), then section 102(c)(1) violates the Presentment Clause (see id. at 45\\u201348); the constitutional non-delegation doctrine (see id. at 48\\u201352); and the Take Care Clause (see id. at 52\\u201354). Plaintiffs further insist that DHS must have relied on this unconstitutional interpretation of the agency's section 102(c)(1) waiver authority in order to issue the New Mexico Waiver, because the \\u201cthe reinforced fencing along ... 700 miles of the southwest border\\u201d that is outlined in section 102(b) had already been completed when the New Mexico Waiver issued. (Pls.' Mem. at 31 (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(b)(1)(A)).)\\nThe first potential impediment to the advancement of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims arose during this Court's motions hearing, when Defendants suddenly asserted, for the first time, that the New Mexico Waiver was issued pursuant to the terms of section 102(b) of the IIRIRA (which authorizes the construction of \\u201cat least 700 miles\\u201d of reinforced fencing along the southwest border, IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(b)), and not in spite of that provision, as Plaintiffs had maintained (see Hr'g Tr. at 77:13\\u201315). A round of supplemental briefing ensued, as mentioned above (see supra Part I.C.), with Plaintiffs contending that \\u201cDHS in fact did not invoke \\u00a7 102(b) in the Waiver notice\\u201d and instead relied solely on section 102(a) with respect to the New Mexico Waiver (Pls.' Suppl. Br., ECF No. 31, at 8 (emphasis in original)), while DHS asserted that \\u201c[t]he Secretary relied both on the general mandate set out in \\u00a7 102(a) ... and the specific call in \\u00a7 102(b)(1) for additional infrastructure needed to gain operational control of the southwest border\\u201d (Defs.' Suppl. Br., ECF No. 33, at 7).\\nAs a preliminary matter, this Court finds that any distinction between, on the one hand, the DHS Secretary's exercise of section 102(c)(1) waiver authority as applied to construction projects generally authorized under the IIRIRA's section 102(a), and, on the other, the invocation of section 102(c)(1) with respect to construction authorized under a differently interpreted section 102(b) that does not limit the DHS Secretary to only 700 miles of construction, makes no difference with respect to the constitutional arguments that Plaintiffs have pressed here.19 Either way, the Court concludes that section 102(c)(1) *244 sufficiently limits DHS's authority so as not to run afoul of the Constitution in the manner that Plaintiffs allege.\\n1. The constitutional limits on Congress's authority to delegate authority to the Executive Branch are well established\\n30\\n31\\n32\\nThe Supreme Court has long recognized that \\u201c[t]he Constitution sought to divide the delegated powers of the new federal government into three defined categories, legislative, executive and judicial, to assure, as nearly as possible, that each Branch of government would confine itself to its assigned responsibility.\\u201d INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983). This hallowed division is reinforced by various constitutional provisions that delineate requirements for each branch in carrying out its duties, in order to maintain that separation of powers. Cf. id. at 957\\u201358, 103 S.Ct. 2764 (\\u201cTo preserve those checks, and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded.\\u201d). The Presentment Clause requires, for example, that \\u201c[e]very Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States[.]\\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \\u00a7 7, cl. 2. Such requirements \\u201cwere intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by mandating certain prescribed steps.\\u201d Chadha, 462 U.S. at 957, 103 S.Ct. 2764. Similarly, \\u201crepeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art[icle] I[,]\\u201d id. at 954, 103 S.Ct. 2764, and \\u201c[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes[,]\\u201d Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998).\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n\\u201cThe nondelegation doctrine is [also] rooted in the principle of separation of powers that underlies our tripartite system of Government.\\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). The Supreme Court explains that doctrine this way: because \\u201c[t]he Constitution provides that \\u2018all legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,\\u2019 and we long have insisted that \\u2018the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution\\u2019 mandate that Congress generally cannot delegate its legislative power to another Branch.\\u201d Id. at 371\\u201372, 109 S.Ct. 647 (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, \\u00a7 1; Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692, 12 S.Ct. 495, 36 L.Ed. 294 (1892)). But Congress can confer its powers within limits; specifically, \\u201c[s]o long as Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\\u201d Id. at 372, 109 S.Ct. 647 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). This means that a congressional delegation of power to the Executive Branch is \\u201cconstitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.\\u201d Id. at 372\\u201373, 109 S.Ct. 647 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Mich. Gambling Opp'n v. Kempthorne, 525 F.3d 23, 30 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Milk Indus. Found. v. Glickman, 132 F.3d 1467, 1475 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\\n37\\n38\\nFinally, separation-of-powers principles also drive evaluations of claims brought under the Constitution's Take Care Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, \\u00a7 3, because such analysis focuses specifically on the President's authority in relation to Congress's. See *245 Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952). \\u201cIn the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\\u201d Id.; see also id. (\\u201cThe Constitution limits [the President's] functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad[,] [a]nd the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute.\\u201d). Thus, the Framers made clear that, far from creating laws that bind the people of the United States, the President \\u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \\u00a7 3 (emphasis added); see also Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 117, 47 S.Ct. 21, 71 L.Ed. 160 (1926) (concluding that the Take Care Clause applies to the entire Executive Branch, rather than the President alone, because, \\u201c[a]s [the President] is charged specifically to take care that [the laws] be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power he should select those who were to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws\\u201d). These separation-of-powers principles are the bedrock of many courts' analyses with respect to constitutional challenges to a federal statute that authorizes broad discretionary decision making by executive branch officials. However, constitutional claims are rarely successful in this context, because courts have construed the circumstances in which congressional action conferring authority to an executive agency transgresses the Constitution's separation-of-powers limits quite narrowly. See, e.g., Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 373, 109 S.Ct. 647 (noting that the Supreme Court has upheld \\u201cwithout deviation, Congress' ability to delegate power under broad standards\\u201d); Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 n.14 (D.D.C. 2014) (\\u201c[A] finding of excessive delegation of authority is extremely rare.\\u201d). As relevant here, by this Court's count, prior plaintiffs have raised Presentment Clause, non-delegation doctrine, and Take Care Clause claims concerning the government's waiver of laws under the IIRIRA's section 102(c)(1) three times in cases in which published opinions have issued, see In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 284 F. Supp. 3d 1092 (S.D. Cal. 2018); Save Our Heritage Org. v. Gonzales, 533 F. Supp. 2d 58 (D.D.C. 2008); Defs. of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2007)\\u2014and none has succeeded. For the reasons that follow, the instant case is no exception.\\n2. A persuasive prior opinion squarely rejects Plaintiffs' separation-of-powers claims in a nearly identical context, and this Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion\\nIn 2007, two animal welfare and environmental protection organizations filed a lawsuit in this district \\u201calleg[ing] that the Secretary of Homeland Security's waiver of numerous federal environmental laws under section 102 of [the IIRIRA] is unconstitutional.\\u201d Defs. of Wildlife v. Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 120\\u201321 (D.D.C. 2007). The legal action concerned the DHS Secretary's invocation of his authority under section 102(c)(1) of the IIRIRA to waive the NEPA and various other laws with respect to a border construction project in Arizona. See id. at 121\\u201322. The plaintiffs alleged that, when invoked in such a manner, the IIRIRA's section 102(c) violates the Presentment Clause, \\u201cbecause it provides the DHS Secretary with a roving commission to repeal, in his sole discretion, any law in all 50 titles of the United States Code that he concludes might impede construction of a border *246 wall[,]\\u201d id. at 123 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and they further maintained that \\u201cthe waiver authority violates fundamental separation of powers principles because it is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Executive Branch[,]\\u201d id. at 126.\\nNotably, with respect to the Presentment Clause claim, the Defenders of Wildlife plaintiffs asserted that \\u201cthe power granted by section 102 of the [IIRIRA] to the Secretary of DHS to waive the applicability of any law that would otherwise apply to border wall and fence construction projects is unmistakably the power partially to repeal or amend such laws,\\u201d because \\u201c[t]he laws waived by the Secretary's federal register notice are repealed ... to the extent that they otherwise would have applied to wall and road construction[.]\\u201d Id. at 124 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). But the court found such arguments \\u201cunavailing,\\u201d id. (Huvelle, J.) (citing Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, Civ. No. 04\\u2013272, 2005 WL 8153059, *7, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, *21 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2005)), because the IIRIRA's waiver provision did not bear the hallmarks of a partial repeal or amendment of a statute in violation of the Presentment Clause that the Supreme Court identified with respect to the Line Item Veto Act in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998).\\nAs Judge Huvelle explained, \\u201c[i]n Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the President the authority to \\u2018cancel\\u2019 certain federal spending items that had been passed by Congress, because the Court found that the Act\\u2014\\u2018[i]n both legal and practical effect\\u2019\\u2014allowed the President to amend Acts of Congress by repealing portions of them.\\u201d Id. at 123 (alteration in original). Judge Huvelle reasoned that \\u201c[i]t was \\u2018critical\\u2019 to the Clinton Court's decision that the Line Item Veto Act essentially \\u2018gave the President the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes[,]\\u2019 \\u201d id. (alterations omitted) (quoting Clinton, 524 U.S. at 437, 447, 118 S.Ct. 2091), and that \\u201c[t]he line items cancelled by the President would no longer have any \\u2018legal force or effect\\u2019 under any circumstance[,]\\u201d id. (quoting Clinton, 524 U.S. at 437, 464, 118 S.Ct. 2091). By contrast, under the IIRIRA's waiver provision, \\u201c[t]he Secretary has no authority to alter the text of any statute, repeal any law, or cancel any statutory provision, in whole or in part.\\u201d Id. And, as Judge Huvelle pointed out, to assert otherwise would effectively transform any Executive Branch waiver (the U.S. Code contains \\u201cmyriad examples\\u201d of such) into a violation of Article I, \\u201cno matter how limited in scope.\\u201d Id. at 124\\u201325.\\n41\\n42\\nIn Defenders of Wildlife, Judge Huvelle further distinguished section 102(c) from the Line Item Veto Act on the grounds that the latter \\u201cauthorized the President \\u2018to effect the repeal of laws for his own policy reasons,\\u2019 thereby \\u2018rejecting the policy judgment made by Congress and relying on his own policy judgment.\\u2019 \\u201d Id. at 125 (alteration omitted) (quoting Clinton, 524 U.S. at 444, 445, 118 S.Ct. 2091). However, \\u201cwhen the DHS Secretary exercises his waiver authority under the [IIRIRA], he is acting as Congress has expressly directed\\u2014i.e., to \\u2018expeditious[ly]\\u2019 construct \\u2018physical barriers and roads ... to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry[.]\\u2019 \\u201d Id. (second alteration and ellipsis in original) (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(a), (c)(1)). Moreover, and finally, \\u201c[t]he [IIRIRA's] waiver provision ... relates to foreign affairs and immigration control[,]\\u201d which are two \\u201carea[s] in which the Executive Branch has traditionally exercised a large degree of discretion.\\u201d Id. at 126; see also *247 Clinton, 524 U.S. at 445, 118 S.Ct. 2091 (explaining that \\u201cthe foreign affairs arena\\u201d is one in which the President has \\u201ca degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved\\u201d).\\nNext, although the plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife did not specifically invoke the Take Care Clause, in support of their claim that the IIRIRA's section 102(c) waiver authority violates the non-delegation doctrine, they asserted that \\u201c[t]he fundamental constitutional role of the Executive Branch under Article II ... is to faithfully execute\\u2014not selectively void\\u2014the laws[,]\\u201d 527 F. Supp. 2d at 126 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and argued that both \\u201c[t]he Secretary's attempt to repeal unilaterally nineteen laws that otherwise would have constrained his conduct, and the law that purports to authorize him in taking such improper action, thus squarely offend both Articles I and II[,]\\u201d id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).20 These arguments also failed to persuade Judge Huvelle.\\nShe persuasively explained that, \\u201c[i]n order to exercise the waiver authority under the [IIRIRA], Congress has required the Secretary to determine if the waiver is \\u2018necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under [section 102 of IIRIRA].\\u2019 \\u201d Id. at 127 (second alteration in original) (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102 (c)(1)). Congress has further directed the Secretary \\u201cto construct fencing only \\u2018in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\\u2019 \\u201d Id. (quoting IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(a)). With these statutory limitations in mind, Judge Huvelle then concluded that \\u201c[t]his legislative directive meets the requirements of the Supreme Court's nondelegation cases[,]\\u201d id., because \\u201c[t]he \\u2018general policy\\u2019 is \\u2018clearly delineated\\u2019\\u2014i.e. to expeditiously \\u2018install additional physical barriers and roads ... to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry[,]\\u2019 \\u201d id. (ellipsis in original) (quoting Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372\\u201373, 109 S.Ct. 647; IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(a)). Moreover, \\u201cthe \\u2018boundaries\\u2019 of the delegated authority are clearly defined by Congress's requirement that the Secretary may waive only those laws that he determines \\u2018necessary to ensure expeditious construction.\\u2019 \\u201d Id. (quoting Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372\\u201373, 109 S.Ct. 647; IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(1)).\\nJudge Huvelle then compared the IIRIRA's waiver provision with delegations of power that the Supreme Court had previously upheld, see id. (citing Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001)), and observed that her conclusion that the IIRIRA's waiver provision does not constitute \\u201can impermissibly standardless delegation\\u201d was \\u201cin accord with the only other decision to address the question of whether the [IIRIRA's] waiver provision is a constitutional delegation[,]\\u201d id. (citing Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059,t *7, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *21). Significantly for present purposes, Judge Huvelle further noted that \\u201ceven if, as argued by plaintiffs, this waiver provision is unique insofar as the number of laws that may be waived is theoretically unlimited, the Secretary may only exercise the waiver authority for the \\u2018narrow purpose\\u2019 prescribed by Congress: \\u2018expeditious completion\\u2019 of the border fences authorized by IIRIRA in areas of high illegal entry.\\u201d Id. at 128 (quoting Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20).\\n*248 In the instant case, Plaintiffs have challenged the exact same statutory provision\\u2014the IIRIRA's section 102(c)(1)\\u2014on the exact same separation-of-powers grounds, and they have done so by repackaging essentially the same constitutional arguments that Judge Huvelle found unpersuasive in Defenders of Wildlife.21\\nNevertheless, Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the instant case from Defenders of Wildlife, first, by asserting that that case \\u201carose in the context of DHS carrying out activities specifically authorized under [IIRIRA section] 102(b)\\u201d (Pls.' Mem. at 48 (citing Defs. of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128)), and, second, by insisting that the Defenders of Wildlife plaintiffs \\u201cnarrowly challenged the constitutionality of the scope of laws that the Secretary may waive\\u2014and did not challenge, as is at issue here, the constitutionality of the waiver's application to types of construction, project geography, and time.\\u201d (Pls.' Opp'n at 36 (emphasis in original).) Both of these contentions miss the mark.\\nTo begin with, nothing about Judge Huvelle's analysis in Defenders of Wildlife turned on section 102(c)'s waiver authority's being limited by section 102(b). See 527 F. Supp. 2d at 123\\u201326 (never mentioning section 102(b) when assessing the plaintiffs' argument that the DHS Secretary's waiver violated the Presentment Clause, nor when concluding that it had not, and quoting only from IIRIRA sections 102(c) and 102(a) when observing that the DHS Secretary acted \\u201cas Congress has expressly directed\\u201d). Furthermore, Defenders of Wildlife does not hold that Congress had provided a sufficiently intelligible principle to guide DHS's authority under the IIRIRA's waiver provision by limiting section 102(c)'s waiver authority to section 102(b) projects. Rather, as the opinion plainly states, Congress provided a guiding principle by specifying that \\u201cthe Secretary may only exercise the waiver authority for the \\u2018narrow purpose\\u2019 prescribed by Congress: \\u2018expeditious completion\\u2019 of the border fences authorized by IIRIRA in areas of high illegal entry[,]\\u201d Defs. of Wildlife, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 128 (quoting Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20), and this principle applies with respect to the New Mexico Waiver as well. Therefore, this Court sees no reason to diverge from Judge Huvelle's reasoning or conclusions *249 under the circumstances presented in this case.\\nNor have Plaintiffs offered any other case that compels a different result. As Judge Huvelle noted, Sierra Club v. Ashcroft does not stand for the proposition that \\u201cthe geographic scope of the waiver authority\\u201d must be \\u201climited\\u201d in order to be constitutional. Id. at 128 n.7.22 \\u201cRather, the court upheld the waiver because the \\u2018necessity\\u2019 standard provided an adequate intelligible principle to circumscribe the action the Secretary was permitted to take.\\u201d Id. (citing Sierra Club, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6\\u20137, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44244, at *20\\u201321). And, importantly, that intelligible principle derives from section 102(c), which authorizes the DHS Secretary to waive laws to the extent that the Secretary \\u201cdetermines\\u201d such waiver is \\u201cnecessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section[,]\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c), and also section 102(a), which authorizes the Secretary to \\u201ctake such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads ... in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States[,]\\u201d id. \\u00a7 102(a). Therefore, section 102(b)'s further direction is functionally unnecessary for section 102(c)(1) to comport with constitutional separation-of-powers principles. Put another way, from the standpoint of what suffices as guidance from Congress regarding how the Executive Branch is to exercise the authority granted in the statute for constitutional purposes, what is set forth in subsections 102(a) and 102(c) is enough. See also Cty. of El Paso v. Chertoff, No. EP-08-CA-196, 2008 WL 4372693, at * 4 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2008) (\\u201c[T]he Waiver Legislation clearly satisfies the intelligible principle standard.\\u201d); Save Our Heritage Org., 533 F. Supp. 2d at 64 (\\u201c[T]his Court finds no constitutional impediment to the Secretary's waivers because there is an intelligible principle that the Secretary must conform to in the exercise of his delegated power.\\u201d).\\n3. Plaintiffs' Take Care Clause claim is another iteration of Plaintiffs' Presentment Clause and non-delegation doctrine arguments, and it fails for the same reasons\\nFinally, \\u201cit is not at all clear that a claim under the Take Care Clause presents a justiciable claim for this Court's resolution.\\u201d Am. Fed. of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 439 (citing Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Trump, 302 F. Supp. 3d 127, 138\\u201340 (D.D.C. 2018)). But even if it does, the Take Care Clause claim that Plaintiffs make in the instant action merely repackages their two other constitutional claims, and, therefore, it must suffer the same fate. Plaintiffs maintain, for example, that \\u201cin issuing the [New Mexico] Waiver, [the DHS Secretary] is purporting to be a lawmaker ..., leading to the effective repeals of portions of duly enacted statutes ... without being confined and guided by the Congressional construction mandate in \\u00a7 102(b)\\u201d (Pls.' Mem. at 53)\\u2014an argument that echoes, almost verbatim, their argument in support of the Presentment Clause claim (see id. at 46 (\\u201c[T]he act of waiving a law's application to border wall construction effectively repeals a portion of that duly enacted statute[.]\\u201d)), as well as *250 their argument in support of the non-delegation doctrine claim (see id. at 49 (arguing that summary judgment is appropriate because the IIRIRA's section 102(c) \\u201clacks the requisite boundaries of this delegated authority\\u201d). (See also Pls.' Opp'n at 40 (clarifying that the Secretary's invocation of IIRIRA section 102(c) violates the Take Care Clause \\u201cbecause the New Mexico Waiver overreaches into Congress's lawmaking authority\\u201d).) Plaintiffs have offered no basis for treating or viewing their Take Care Clause claim as anything other than a rehashing of the same concern that animates Plaintiffs' Presentment and non-delegation claims\\u2014i.e., that Congress has delegated to DHS unlimited authority to exercise, in essence, legislative power, in a manner that the U.S. Constitution does not permit\\u2014and this Court has already explained why Plaintiffs have failed to establish that section 102(c)(1) and the New Mexico Waiver \\u201coverreach[ ] into Congress's lawmaking authority\\u201d in violation of the Constitution's separation-of-powers principles. (See supra Part III.B.2.)\\nBecause Plaintiffs' underdeveloped Take Care Clause claim is founded on the legal arguments that this Court has already rejected, it requires nothing more in terms of analysis. Therefore, this Court's prior reasoning is the basis for its present conclusion that Plaintiffs' Take Care Clause claim must be dismissed as well.\\nIV. CONCLUSION\\nThis Court finds that Congress has spoken in no uncertain terms about the limits of judicial review when it comes to legal claims that challenge on non-constitutional grounds the DHS Secretary's authority to waive otherwise-applicable legal requirements with respect to the construction of border barriers under the IIRIRA. Indeed, the IIRIRA's section 102(c)(2)(A) specifically states that, with respect to \\u201ccauses or claims arising from any action undertaken, or any decision made, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to [section 102(c)(1)],\\u201d such a \\u201ccause of action or claim may only be brought alleging a violation of the Constitution of the United States[,] [and] [t]he court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim not specified in this subparagraph.\\u201d IIRIRA \\u00a7 102(c)(2)(A). Thus, this Court has no authority to consider the merits of Plaintiffs' arguments that the New Mexico Waiver is ultra vires or otherwise unlawful. And to the extent that Plaintiffs have proceeded to make Presentment Clause, non-delegation doctrine, and Take Care Clause claims regarding the impermissibility of the New Mexico Waiver, they have done so against the backdrop of a prior determination by a judge in this district that section 102 provides sufficient limitations on DHS's authority so as not to violate the Constitution's separation-of-powers principles. This Court finds that precedent persuasive, and it compels the conclusion that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state plausible constitutional claims as a matter of law.\\nAccordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment must be DENIED, and Defendants' motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment must be GRANTED.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":53}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Jackson.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"X6CrYj-jeZBR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495473642,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"}},"outputId":"47e23c25-edc6-43ec-ce6e-de486bfeede7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(80, 5)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":54}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Barrett"],"metadata":{"id":"jhp6P1gyd0Mq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Barrett = pd.read_excel('data/Barrett.xlsx')\n","Barrett['date'] = pd.to_datetime(Barrett['date'])\n","Barrett['year'] = Barrett['date'].dt.year\n","Barrett['author'] = 'Barrett'\n","Barrett['type'] = 'majority'\n","Barrett.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\n","Barrett = Barrett.groupby(['type', 'author', 'case_name', 'year'])['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x)).reset_index()\n","Barrett = Barrett[Barrett.text.str.len()>3000]\n","Barrett['year'] = Barrett['year'].astype(int)"],"metadata":{"id":"UHbLdwLXd3-I"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Barrett.sample(3)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"id":"AvhnWKYsC0wU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495538186,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"}},"outputId":"302a4eca-5ce0-45a9-87c6-d925aeba6154"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        type   author                                         case_name  year  \\\n","57  majority  Barrett                           United States v.

At sentencing, the district court applied a four-level enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with felony possession of drugs. But because the district court made essentially no factual findings connecting Briggs\\u2019s firearms to his felony drug possession, we reverse and remand for resentencing.\\nI.\\nIn December 2016, Indiana state parole officers conducted a parole visit at Alandous Briggs\\u2019s home. After consenting to a search, he admitted that there was marijuana (299 grams), cocaine (.45 grams), and firearms (3 loaded handguns) in the master bedroom. On a shelf next to the marijuana, the officers also found a digital scale. The officers arrested Briggs and seized his cell phone\\u2014which turned out to contain pictures and texts confirming that the guns were his.\\nBriggs was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Although the parties did not come to a plea agreement, Briggs petitioned to enter a plea of guilty and requested a presentence investigation report. The probation office\\u2019s initial report concluded that Briggs had committed a felony drug offense in connection with the firearm possession, which warranted a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (specifying an enhancement for those who \\u201cused or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense\\u201d). Briggs filed an objection to this enhancement, arguing that his firearm possession was unrelated to the drugs found in his home.\\nThe district court conducted a combined plea and sentencing hearing. After *1032 accepting his plea, the district court turned to Briggs\\u2019s sentencing objection. The government claimed that the enhancement applied based on two separate felonies: felony drug possession and felony drug trafficking. Briggs again maintained that his firearms were unrelated to the drugs. But the district court held that the enhancement applied and sentenced Briggs to 84 months.\\nBriggs appeals that sentencing decision. His sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred by finding that his possession of firearms was connected to another felony.\\nII.\\nAs an initial matter, the government claims that the district court found that the enhancement applied based on both felony drug possession and felony drug trafficking. We disagree. The district court discussed both felonies at sentencing, but it ultimately concluded that only felony drug possession triggered the enhancement. It explained that although \\u201cthere\\u2019s an inference that the defendant may have been involved in some drug distribution, ... at minim[um], he was possessing drugs.\\u201d (emphasis added). We take this to mean that the district court wasn\\u2019t deciding whether the enhancement applied because of the suspected drug trafficking, resting its decision instead only on felony possession, which Briggs admitted. Thus, the question that we face on appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding that the enhancement applied in connection with Briggs\\u2019s felony possession of cocaine.1\\n1\\nTo enhance a defendant\\u2019s sentence for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony, the firearm must have been connected to the second crime. See U.S.S.G. \\u00a7 2K2.1 & cmt. n. 14(A) (stating that \\u201cin connection with\\u201d means that the firearm \\u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense\\u201d). We have noted before that \\u201c[m]ere contemporaneous possession while another felony is being committed is not necessarily sufficient, and possessing a gun while engaged in the casual use of drugs might not give rise to the inference that the gun was possessed in connection with the drugs.\\u201d United States v. LePage, 477 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir. 2007).\\n2\\nThe problem here is that the district never made any findings about how Briggs\\u2019s felony cocaine possession was connected to his firearms. It simply assumed that because the firearms were probably connected to drug trafficking (because of the combination of the cocaine, marijuana, and digital scale), they were probably connected to his mere possession of the cocaine. But that logic doesn\\u2019t hold up. Analyzing whether firearms are connected to drug trafficking is different from analyzing whether they are connected to possessing a small quantity of drugs. See id. (explaining that the existence of a dilution agent, for example, was \\u201cconsistent with being a dealer and not simply a casual user of the drug\\u201d); United States v. Smith, 535 F.3d 883, 885\\u201386 (8th Cir. 2008) (noting the differences between drug trafficking and drug possession as it relates to the \\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement). In fact, the guidelines themselves distinguish between drug trafficking and other offenses like drug possession. See \\u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(B) (specifying that the enhancement applies to a \\u201cdrug trafficking offense\\u201d when drug-manufacturing *1033 materials are found in proximity to firearms).\\nPerhaps the district court here thought that the guns emboldened Briggs\\u2019s possession of cocaine. See, e.g., United States v. Jenkins, 566 F.3d 160, 163 (4th Cir. 2009) (applying the enhancement to a defendant who brought cocaine and a gun onto a public street because the \\u201cenvironment suggest[ed] that there was a heightened need for protection and that the firearm emboldened [him]\\u201d). Or maybe it thought that because Briggs had both cocaine and marijuana in the house, he simply wanted to protect all of the drugs that he had there. But the problem is that we don\\u2019t know what the district court thought. Put differently, \\u201c[w]e have essentially no fact findings at all by the district court relevant to this issue.\\u201d United States v. Clinton, 825 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 2016) (emphasis added). The district court mostly discussed the drug scale and the amount of marijuana found in Briggs\\u2019s home\\u2014but neither of those facts bears directly on Briggs\\u2019s cocaine possession. Instead, they go to whether he might have been dealing drugs. And the court\\u2019s vague suggestion that the guns might have been there \\u201cto protect something\\u201d\\u2014apparently made in the context of drug trafficking\\u2014wouldn\\u2019t be enough to connect the guns to felony possession of cocaine even if that had been what the court was referring to.\\n3\\nIn short, the mere fact that guns and drugs are found near each other doesn\\u2019t establish a nexus between them.

There can, of course, be no doubt that Congress has invested the Board with considerable power to shape labor relations in this country and to provide remedies like backpay in response to employer misconduct. But in our legal order federal agencies must take care to respect the boundaries of their congressional charters. They may not treat similarly situated classes of persons differently without a rational explanation. And they may not depart from their own existing rules and precedents without a persuasive explanation. See, e.g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Respectfully, I believe the NLRB's new rule fails to abide each of these settled legal principles and, in that way, seeks to make new law unlawfully.\\nSince 1935 Congress has tasked the Board with the job of \\u201celiminat[ing] the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce\\u201d by promoting collective bargaining. 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 151. In aid of that expansive charge, Congress has endowed the Board with considerable remedial authority. If and when it should find that an employer subject to its jurisdiction has engaged in an unlawful labor practice, the Board may issue an order \\u201crequiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without backpay, as will effectuate the policies\\u201d of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 160(c).\\nOver the last eighty years, the Board has developed a finely reticulated set of rules aimed at implementing these statutory directives. Of special relevance in this case about backpay, the Board has held that when an employer unlawfully fires an employee or reduces her hours the employer must pay all the wages the employee lost as a result. N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10536.1. At the same time, this general rule sometimes yields to more specific ones in order to avoid over- or under-compensating the employee. So, for example, after an unlawful labor action an employee may find a new job or increase her hours at a pre-existing second job and in that way replace some or all of her lost wages. Allowing the employee *781 in these circumstances to keep both her \\u201cinterim earnings\\u201d and a full backpay award would mean she'd be paid twice for the same hours, leaving her better off than she would have been but-for the employer's misconduct. To avoid this sort of \\u201cwindfall\\u201d the Board has, from its first order and still to this day, generally deducted interim earnings from its backpay awards. In re Pa. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 1 N.L.R.B. 1 (1935); N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10554. Indeed, if the employer can prove the employee could've found a second job after being unlawfully fired but unreasonably refused the work, the employee's intentionally forgone interim earnings may also be deducted from a backpay award. N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10558.1. At the same time, though, if the employee incurs costs in finding or retaining a second job thanks to the employer's misconduct, those costs are fully compensable. Id. \\u00a7 10555. And if in the second job the employee takes on \\u201cextra work\\u201d\\u2014working hours beyond those she would otherwise have spent with the wrongdoing employer\\u2014compensation for that extra work remains hers and isn't used to offset any backpay award. Id. \\u00a7 10554.3. All of these additions and subtractions share the common aim of ensuring that a backpay award restores the employee to the same position she would've enjoyed but-for the employer's misconduct, without a windfall accruing to either employer or employee.\\nNow eighty years on, the Board seeks to carve out a class of cases from its tested and pretty ancient backpay procedures. When the employer unlawfully reduces the employee's hours to zero (termination cases), the Board says it will continue to employ its traditional backpay rules. But when the employer unlawfully reduces the employee's hours to anything short of zero (hours-reduction cases), the Board now says it will never, under any circumstances, deduct interim earnings from a backpay award. Thus treating cases that seem to differ mostly in degree as different in kind.\\nThe hospital-employer in our case first challenged the Board's new carve-out rule for hours-reduction cases in the D.C. Circuit. There the Board tried to suggest that its new rule wasn't really anything new at all but compelled by an existing administrative decision, Ogle Protection Service, Inc., 183 N.L.R.B. 682 (1970). The D.C. Circuit quickly exposed this claim as mistaken. Yes, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged, the Board in Ogle ordered backpay and authorized no deductions for interim earnings. But, the court observed, Ogle wasn't an hours-reduction case and the employees there had no interim earnings that could have been deducted from their backpay awards. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit observed, Ogle just \\u201cdoes not address\\u201d hours-reduction cases where (as here) the employer does proffer evidence of interim employee earnings that might be deducted. Deming Hosp. Corp. v. NLRB, 665 F.3d 196, 200 (D.C.Cir.2011). In fact, the D.C. Circuit noted, in many past hours-reduction cases the Board has ordered the deduction of proven interim earnings. See id. at 201 (citing examples). And the Board's own casehandling manual states that interim earnings deductions are generally appropriate with only a few exceptions\\u2014and hours-reduction cases are nowhere among those exceptions. See N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10554.\\nForced to acknowledge that its carve-out rule represents a departure from preexisting practice, the Board offered an alternative rationale in its defense. Now the Board argued that, in response to unlawful reductions in their hours, employees should not face a duty to seek out secondary employment\\u2014to mitigate their losses *782 \\u2014like employees in termination cases do. For its part the D.C. Circuit noted that employees in termination cases have a duty to mitigate their losses in the sense that, if they refuse to take new work, they will have their backpay award reduced by the amount of intentionally forgone income they could've earned. And for purposes of the appeal, the D.C. Circuit and hospital-employer accepted that there's a sound reason to avoid imposing a parallel duty to mitigate on employees in hours-reduction cases\\u2014because in hours-reduction cases employees seeking secondary work will have to work around the demands of their still-existing primary employer and may not be able to secure a replacement job or as many hours in a replacement job as the employee might wish. At the same time, the court noted, this consideration speaks only to a need to waive any duty to seek secondary employment in hours-reduction cases\\u2014to eschew backpay deductions when employees don't have interim earnings. It does not provide a rational basis for distinguishing between termination and hours-reduction cases when employees are able to and do choose to find other work\\u2014when employers do have interim earnings during the backpay period. Given all this, the D.C. Circuit held that the Board's \\u201cexplanation for its refusal to consider interim earnings is inadequate\\u201d and remanded the matter for reconsideration. Deming Hosp. Corp., 665 F.3d at 201.\\nNow the Board has tried again, and the hospital-employer has petitioned for review again\\u2014this time to our court. In an apparent abundance of caution the Board has offered five new rationales to replace the two the D.C. Circuit found wanting. But though the Board's rationales may now be more prolific, I do not find them more persuasive for it.\\n1. \\u201cPromoting Production and Employment.\\u201d First and primarily the Board argues that its new policy of refusing to deduct interim earnings in hours-reduction cases will allow employees who take on second jobs to keep both their interim earnings and backpay for the same hours they would have worked for their primary employer. Of course this means a whole class of employees (those in hours-reduction cases who seek and win second jobs) won't be restored to the same position they would've been in but-for the employer's misconduct, but will be made better off instead. The Board accepts that its new rule creates an employee \\u201cwindfall\\u201d in just this way and seemingly at odds with its prior practice. Yet it defends this consequence not as a bug in the design of its new rule but as its whole point. Promising employees double payment for the same hours, the Board says, will offer them a \\u201cgreater incentive to voluntarily seek interim employment\\u201d and in this way advance the policy of \\u201cpromoting production and employment.\\u201d Cmty. Health Servs., Inc., 361 N.L.R.B. No.25, 2014 WL 4202633, at *7; see Maj. Op. at 776\\u201377.\\nIt seems to me that this line of argument fundamentally misconceives the Board's remedial charter. The Board's statutory charge isn't to promote full employment. See 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 151. It's not some sort of reincarnation of the Works Progress Administration. Instead, Congress invested the Board with the more prosaic\\u2014if still vital\\u2014job of providing \\u201cbackpay\\u201d arising from \\u201cunfair labor practices.\\u201d 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 160(c). And the Supreme Court has held that this statutory charter means exactly what it says\\u2014allowing the Board to restore the \\u201cactual losses\\u201d employees suffer\\u2014no more or less. Phelps Dodge v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 197\\u201398, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). Yet, rather than seeking to restore the earnings employees would have enjoyed but-for the employer's misconduct, the Board's new rule candidly seeks to pursue *783 a quite different and entirely extra-statutory objective\\u2014the promotion of \\u201cproduction and employment\\u201d\\u2014and to achieve that end it abandons any pretense of seeking to fulfill its duty of ensuring compensation for actual losses. The Supreme Court long ago rejected Board efforts to use its remedial backpay authority to pursue policy ends other than those specified by the NLRA. Back in the 1940s, and in words equally fitting here, the Court held that while the Board may freely pursue \\u201cremedial objectives which the Act sets forth,\\u201d it is not licensed to pursue \\u201ca distinct and broader policy with respect to unemployment.\\u201d Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 12\\u201313, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940); see also Phelps Dodge, 313 U.S. at 197\\u201398, 61 S.Ct. 845 (holding that the NLRA limits the Board's backpay authority to restoring \\u201cactual losses\\u201d). I do not see how we might come to a different conclusion today.\\nIn saying this much, I hardly mean to suggest the Board lacks leeway in carrying out its remedial charge. Any attempt to recreate a lost but-for world and calculate losses due to a defendant's misconduct always requires a degree of estimation. As well, the Board must balance its two statutory remedial duties\\u2014providing backpay for actual losses and promoting reinstatement\\u2014and those two duties can sometimes conflict in interesting and difficult ways. See, e.g., NLRB v. Seven\\u2013Up Bottling Co. of Miami, 344 U.S. 344, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953). Finally, the Supreme Court has observed that, when a backpay award does aim to restore \\u201cactual losses,\\u201d its virtue may be additionally recommended by its capacity to promote employment because, in that scenario, the consideration of extra-statutory policies like that one \\u201cin no way weakens the enforcement of the policies of the Act.\\u201d Phelps Dodge, 313 U.S. at 200, 61 S.Ct. 845. But none of these principles suffices to save the Board's order in this case. After all, no one before us disputes that the Board's existing and longstanding backpay rules allow it to supply employees with all of their actual losses in hours-reduction cases. The Board itself doesn't even attempt to suggest its new carve-out rule offers a superior way to calculate actual losses. Instead, the Board seeks to justify its new carve-out backpay rule exclusively on the ground that it will better promote an entirely distinct policy that lies beyond its statutory authority to pursue.\\nBesides exceeding its congressional charter, the Board's rationale faces still two more problems. In the first place, a consistent (non-arbitrary) application of its new rule would seem to forbid the deduction of interim earnings for both termination and hours-reduction cases. After all, if double pay for the same hours will encourage you to take on outside work when the hours in your primary job are reduced to something short of zero, it will encourage you to take on outside work in cases when the hours in your primary job are reduced to zero too. Nothing about the Board's rationale is rationally confined to hours-reduction cases. Yet it's those cases alone the Board today wishes to carve out, without any explanation why. Beyond even that, by enforcing a backpay regime that is markedly more generous in hours-reduction cases than termination cases the Board's new rule would seem to create a paradoxical incentive for employers to engage in behavior even more inimical to the \\u201cpromotion of production and employment\\u201d\\u2014pushing them in marginal cases toward termination and away from hours-reductions in order to reduce their backpay liability. Yet another problem the Board neither ponders nor offers reason for disregarding.\\n2. \\u201cRewarding Extra Work.\\u201d If its primary rationale should fail, the Board argues *784 alternatively that its new carve-out rule is justified by the \\u201cwell established\\u201d principle found in \\u00a7 10554.3 of its casehandling manual providing that \\u201c[i]n cases where a discriminatee worked substantially more hours for an interim employer than he or she would have worked for the gross employer, only interim earnings based on the same number of hours as would have been available at the gross employer should be offset against gross backpay.\\u201d N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10554.3.\\nBy its terms, however, this provision can be fairly described as no better than irrelevant. Section 10554.3 merely provides that an employee gets to keep interim earnings for hours above and beyond those she would have worked at the original employer\\u2014promising that the employee can always retain earnings from a true second or \\u201cmoonlighting\\u201d job. And exactly none of this is at issue here. Everyone before us readily accepts that the sort of wages \\u00a7 10554.3 discusses belong to the employee. The only question presented in this case is what to do about earnings for those hours the employee would have worked for the original employer but-for the unlawful action\\u2014and on that question \\u00a7 10554.3 stands mute.\\nMaybe the Board's citation to \\u00a7 10554.3 is meant less than literally, as a sort of analogy. Maybe the Board means to suggest that, just as an employee shouldn't have her backpay hours reduced for hours beyond those she could have worked at her employer, she shouldn't ever have her hours reduced for taking on a second job when she didn't have to. But if that's the analogy that's intended, it's one that fails. It fails because the point of \\u00a7 10554.3 is to ensure that the employee is made whole for her actual losses by guaranteeing that her backpay award isn't reduced by earnings she would have enjoyed whether or not her primary employer engaged in an unfair labor practice. Section \\u00a7 10554.3 removes from the backpay analysis interim earnings without a causal connection to the employer's misconduct. The rule is, in this way, all about helping create an accurate picture of what the world would've looked like but-for the employer's misconduct\\u2014and in that way all about helping fulfill the Board's statutory remedial charge. Meanwhile, the Board's new carve-out rule has again (and admittedly) nothing to do with its statutory charter. The Board doesn't attempt to defend its new rule on the ground that it helps create a more accurate picture of an employee's actual losses. Or that it has anything to do with that purpose at all. Instead, it argues the rule aims to reward \\u201cextra work\\u201d in the very particular (and very different) sense that, thanks to the windfall it offers employees, it encourages them to take on second jobs and, in that way, promotes \\u201cproduction and employment.\\u201d So it is the Board's second, \\u201cextra work\\u201d rationale at best folds right back into its first and returns us to all the problems we've already encountered.\\n3. \\u201cAccounting for Additional Hardships.\\u201d Here the Board points to the fact that, unlike employees in termination cases, employees who face reductions in their hours and proceed to seek a second job must \\u201cadjust any outside employment hours to accommodate [the primary] employer's demands.\\u201d So, for example, they have to \\u201cresolv[e] scheduling conflicts between the two jobs and traveling to a second workplace.\\u201d By refusing to deduct interim earnings, the Board seems to imply, its new rule will ensure that the particular costs borne by employees in hours-reduction cases are fully compensated.\\nThe problem is the Board's existing rules already do this. Under its existing remedial regime, the Board is indubitably *785 free to compensate an employee for any costs incurred in taking on or holding a second job thanks to the employer's unlawful actions\\u2014including costs associated with resolving scheduling conflicts or traveling between workplaces. N.L.R.B. Casehandling Manual, pt. 3, \\u00a7 10555. Indeed, the Board's order identifies no class of costs its existing remedial rules fail to capture. And before departing from its existing rules the Board must offer some reason for doing so, some reason why its new rule might be rationally preferred to its existing authorities. It doesn't even try. Perhaps the Board might respond by suggesting that some costs employees suffer are intangible and incalculable\\u2014and that its new carve-out rule does a better job of compensating for such costs. But it's far from clear the Board means to pursue such an argument. After all, the Board itself cites by way of support the entirely tangible and calculable costs associated with \\u201ctraveling to a second workplace.\\u201d And even if it were fair to read the Board as making a sort of \\u201cintangible cost\\u201d argument, it would still face its problems. For the Board nowhere explains how its statutory charge to order backpay entails with it the authority to afford tort-like remedies for psychic and other losses not associated with lost wages. And even on its own terms the Board's argument proves too much. While employees in hours-reduction cases may face unique costs in traveling between and juggling two jobs, it's surely not the case that they alone suffer intangible hardships: you might even expect the intangible human costs associated with wrongful terminations to be worse than those associated with wrongful hours-reductions. Yet the Board's new rule seeks to distinguish between the two types of cases when it comes to intangible hardships\\u2014and does so without offering an explanation why the one situation should receive solicitude the other does not.\\n4. \\u201cPreventing Dilatory Conduct.\\u201d Here the Board points out that the duty to provide backpay sometimes can have unintended consequences on \\u201cthe companion remedial requirement\\u201d of reinstatement\\u2014by giving employers an incentive to prolong their unlawful labor practices while an employee's interim earnings grow and the employer's corresponding backpay obligation diminishes. The Board suggests its new carve-out rule will help curb this incentive.\\nI don't see how. No one doubts that the Board must create remedial rules that balance between the statutorily authorized remedies of backpay and reinstatement. No one doubts either that pursuing one remedy without an eye on the other can create strange incentives like the one the Board has identified. But many decades ago the Board identified and devised a solution to the very problem it points to today. Before In re F.W. Woolworth Co., 90 N.L.R.B. 289 (1950), the Board's blanket deduction of interim earnings almost perfectly achieved the policy of making employees whole when it came to backpay\\u2014they received no more and no less than they would have received at their original job. But employers would sometimes delay reinstatement to reduce their backpay obligations, a result inimical to the Board's second statutorily prescribed remedial objective and preventing \\u201ca restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.\\u201d Id. at 292. The Board's solution, approved by the Supreme Court in Seven\\u2013Up, was a quarterly deduction formula that, while sometimes resulting in a less-than-perfect award of backpay, effectively eliminated the employer's incentive to drag out reinstatement and thus achieved a reasonable balance *786 between the Board's two remedial charges. 344 U.S. at 345\\u201348, 73 S.Ct. 287. In our case, the Board acknowledges that it faces the same problem it solved in Woolworth. And it doesn't disparage the Woolworth solution or even question that it adequately eliminates the unwanted employer incentive. In fact, it continues to apply the Woolworth solution to termination cases. And (again) I just don't see how the agency might be permitted to depart from a well-established policy or eschew an obvious alternative without offering some reasoned explanation consistent with its statutory charter.\\n5. \\u201cAllocating Windfalls.\\u201d Finally, the Board contends that, if it deducts interim earnings, employers will receive a windfall. But if it refuses to deduct interim earnings, employees will receive a windfall. One side or the other will inevitably come out better than they would have but-for the unlawful labor practice, the Board says, so it should have the discretion to allocate the windfall as it wishes. And because the employee seeking additional work is promoting production and employment through her extra effort (back once more to that doubtful rationale), that's tie-breaker enough.\\nThis is perhaps the Board's most curious argument yet. Over eight decades the Board has taken pains to develop a set of rules that prevents windfalls for either side. To prevent employee windfalls, the Board has long deducted interim earnings. And to prevent employer windfalls, the Board's existing rules and precedents afford it the power to order the employer to (1) pay backpay without deduction if an employee chooses not to find a second job in hours-reduction cases, (2) pay any and all costs an employee incurs if she does take on a second job, and (3) ensure any backpay deductions for interim earnings are limited to the hours the employee would've worked for the wrongdoing employer. In this light, it's hard to see what windfall might fall into the employer's lap\\u2014or how, should the problem arise, the Board could not lawfully get at it. For again, the Board's existing remedial precedents and rules permit it to order compensation for all actual losses. Strangely, the Board ignores all this\\u2014all the careful handiwork of generations of Board members aimed at securing a tailored remedy approximating actual losses\\u2014nowhere explaining why those efforts fail only now and only in the context of hours-reduction cases.\\nIn the end, it's difficult to come away from this case without wondering if the Board's actions stem from a frustration with the current statutory limits on its remedial powers\\u2014a frustration that it cannot pursue more tantalizing goals like punishing employers for unlawful actions or maximizing employment; that it is limited instead to the more workmanlike task of ensuring employees win backpay awards that approximate the actual losses they've suffered. A frustration that seems to parallel the frustration the Board experienced when it sought in Republic Steel and Phelps Dodge to issue similarly expansive extra-statutory remedies. But then as now frustration should not beget license. In our legal order the proper avenue for addressing any dissatisfaction with congressional limits on agency authority lies in new legislation, not administrative ipse dixit. I respectfully dissent.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":67}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gorsuch.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0a2frEsBe-tA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495634260,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"}},"outputId":"c9492012-f900-4140-a0ba-c924c03645b4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(59, 5)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":68}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gDa7jQhhzhgc"},"source":["### Kavanaugh"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"987ZiUPOzmQe"},"outputs":[],"source":["Kavanaugh = pd.read_excel('data/Kavanaugh.xlsx')\n","Kavanaugh['date'] = pd.to_datetime(Kavanaugh['date'])\n","Kavanaugh['year'] = Kavanaugh['date'].dt.year\n","Kavanaugh['author'] = 'Kavanaugh'\n","Kavanaugh['type'] = 'majority'\n","Kavanaugh.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\n","Kavanaugh = Kavanaugh.groupby(['type', 'author', 'case_name', 'year'])['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x)).reset_index()\n","Kavanaugh = Kavanaugh[Kavanaugh.text.str.len()>3000]\n","Kavanaugh['year'] = Kavanaugh['year'].astype(int)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495581569,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"3eni886O0ClF","outputId":"b3a408c3-bc15-4ba6-abe2-0ec9ff22db77"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        type     author                                          case_name  \\\n","32  majority  Kavanaugh                   In re Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc.   \n","51  majority  Kavanaugh                                   Loving v.

See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). In this case, the District Court denied the protection of the privilege to a company that had conducted just such an internal investigation. The District Court's decision has generated substantial uncertainty about the scope of the attorney-client privilege in the business setting. We conclude that theDistrict Court's decision is irreconcilable with Upjohn. We therefore grant KBR's petition for a writ of mandamus and vacate the District Court's March 6 document production order.\\nI\\nHarry Barko worked for KBR, a defense contractor. In 2005, he filed a False Claims Act complaint against KBR and KBR-related corporate entities, whom we will collectively refer to as KBR. In essence, Barko alleged that KBR and certain subcontractors defrauded the U.S. Government by inflating costs and accepting kickbacks while administering military contracts in wartime Iraq. During discovery, Barko sought documents related to KBR's prior internal investigation into the alleged fraud. KBR had conducted that internal investigation pursuant to its Code of Business Conduct, which is overseen by the company's Law Department.\\nKBR argued that the internal investigation had been conducted for the purpose of obtaining legal advice and that the internal investigation documents therefore were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Barko responded that the internal investigation documents were unprivileged business records that he was entitled to discover. See generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).\\nAfter reviewing the disputed documents in camera, the District Court determined that the attorney-client privilege protection did not apply because, among other reasons, KBR had not shown that \\u201cthe communication would not have been made \\u2018but for\\u2019 the fact that legal advice was sought.\\u201d United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., No. 1:05\\u2013cv\\u20131276, \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013 F.3d \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013, \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013, 2014 WL 1016784, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2014) (quoting United States v. ISS Marine Services, Inc., 905 F.Supp.2d 121, 128 (D.D.C.2012)). KBR's internal investigation, the court concluded, was \\u201cundertaken pursuant to regulatory law and corporate policy rather than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\\u201d Id. at \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013, 2014 WL 1016784, at *3.\\nKBR vehemently opposed the ruling. The company asked the District Court to certify the privilege question to this Court for interlocutory appeal and to stay its order pending a petition for mandamus in this Court. The District Court denied those requests and ordered KBR to produce the disputed documents to Barko within a matter of days. See United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., No. 1:05\\u2013cv\\u20131276, 2014 WL 929430 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2014). KBR promptly filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court. A number of business organizations and trade associations also objected to the District Court's decision and filed an amicus brief in support of KBR. We stayed the District Court's document production order and held oral argument on the mandamus petition.\\nThe threshold question is whether the District Court's privilege ruling constituted legal error. If not, mandamus is of course inappropriate. If the District Court's ruling was erroneous, the remaining **385 *757 question is whether that error is the kind that justifies mandamus. See Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380\\u201381, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). We address those questions in turn.\\nII\\n1\\nWe first consider whether the District Court's privilege ruling was legally erroneous. We conclude that it was.\\nFederal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that claims of privilege in federal courts are governed by the \\u201ccommon law\\u2014as interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience.\\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 501. The attorney-client privilege is the \\u201coldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). As relevant here, the privilege applies to a confidential communication between attorney and client if that communication was made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice to the client. See 1 Restatement (Third) Of The Law Governing Lawyers \\u00a7\\u00a7 68\\u201372 (2000); In re Grand Jury, 475 F.3d 1299, 1304 (D.C.Cir.2007); In re Lindsey, 158 F.3d 1263, 1270 (D.C.Cir.1998); In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d 94, 98\\u201399 (D.C.Cir.1984); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976) ( \\u201cConfidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance are privileged.\\u201d).\\nIn Upjohn, the Supreme Court held that the attorney-client privilege applies to corporations. The Court explained that the attorney-client privilege for business organizations was essential in light of \\u201cthe vast and complicated array of regulatory legislation confronting the modern corporation,\\u201d which required corporations to \\u201cconstantly go to lawyers to find out how to obey the law, ... particularly since compliance with the law in this area is hardly an instinctive matter.\\u201d 449 U.S. at 392, 101 S.Ct. 677 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court stated, moreover, that the attorney-client privilege \\u201cexists to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.\\u201d Id. at 390, 101 S.Ct. 677. That is so, the Court said, because the \\u201cfirst step in the resolution of any legal problem is ascertaining the factual background and sifting through the facts with an eye to the legally relevant.\\u201d Id. at 390\\u201391, 101 S.Ct. 677. In Upjohn, the communications were made by company employees to company attorneys during an attorney-led internal investigation that was undertaken to ensure the company's \\u201ccompliance with the law.\\u201d Id. at 392, 101 S.Ct. 677; see id. at 394, 101 S.Ct. 677. The Court ruled that the privilege applied to the internal investigation and covered the communications between company employees and company attorneys.\\nKBR's assertion of the privilege in this case is materially indistinguishable from Upjohn's assertion of the privilege in that case. As in Upjohn, KBR initiated an internal investigation to gather facts and ensure compliance with the law after being informed of potential misconduct. And as in Upjohn, KBR's investigation was conducted under the auspices of KBR's in-house legal department, acting in its legal capacity. The same considerations that led the Court in Upjohn to uphold the corporation's privilege claims apply here.\\nThe District Court in this case initially distinguished Upjohn on a variety of grounds. But none of those purported distinctions takes this case out from under Upjohn 's umbrella.\\n*758\\n2\\n**386 First, the District Court stated that in Upjohn the internal investigation began after in-house counsel conferred with outside counsel, whereas here the investigation was conducted in-house without consultation with outside lawyers. But Upjohn does not hold or imply that the involvement of outside counsel is a necessary predicate for the privilege to apply. On the contrary, the general rule, which this Court has adopted, is that a lawyer's status as in-house counsel \\u201cdoes not dilute the privilege.\\u201d In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 99. As the Restatement's commentary points out, \\u201cInside legal counsel to a corporation or similar organization ... is fully empowered to engage in privileged communications.\\u201d 1 Restatement \\u00a7 72, cmt. c, at 551.\\n3\\nSecond, the District Court noted that in Upjohn the interviews were conducted by attorneys, whereas here many of the interviews in KBR's investigation were conducted by non-attorneys. But the investigation here was conducted at the direction of the attorneys in KBR's Law Department. And communications made by and to non-attorneys serving as agents of attorneys in internal investigations are routinely protected by the attorney-client privilege. See FTC v. TRW, Inc., 628 F.2d 207, 212 (D.C.Cir.1980); see also 1 Paul R. Rice, Attorney\\u2013Client Privilege in the United States \\u00a7 7:18, at 1230\\u201331 (2013) (\\u201cIf internal investigations are conducted by agents of the client at the behest of the attorney, they are protected by the attorney-client privilege to the same extent as they would be had they been conducted by the attorney who was consulted.\\u201d). So that fact, too, is not a basis on which to distinguish Upjohn.\\nThird, the District Court pointed out that in Upjohn the interviewed employees were expressly informed that the purpose of the interview was to assist the company in obtaining legal advice, whereas here they were not. The District Court further stated that the confidentiality agreements signed by KBR employees did not mention that the purpose of KBR's investigation was to obtain legal advice. Yet nothing in Upjohn requires a company to use magic words to its employees in order to gain the benefit of the privilege for an internal investigation. And in any event, here as in Upjohn employees knew that the company's legal department was conducting an investigation of a sensitive nature and that the information they disclosed would be protected. Cf. Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 387, 101 S.Ct. 677 (Upjohn's managers were \\u201cinstructed to treat the investigation as \\u2018highly confidential\\u2019 \\u201d). KBR employees were also told not to discuss their interviews \\u201cwithout the specific advance authorization of KBR General Counsel.\\u201d United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., No. 1:05\\u2013cv\\u20131276 \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013 F.3d \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013, \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013 n. 33, 2014 WL 1016784, at *3 n. 33 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2014).\\nIn short, none of those three distinctions of Upjohn holds water as a basis for denying KBR's privilege claim.\\nMore broadly and more importantly, the District Court also distinguished Upjohn on the ground that KBR's internal investigation was undertaken to comply with Department of Defense regulations that require defense contractors such as KBR to maintain compliance programs and conduct internal investigations into allegations of potential wrongdoing. The District Court therefore concluded that the purpose of KBR's internal investigation was to comply with those regulatory requirements rather than to obtain or provide legal advice. In our view, the District Court's analysis rested on a false dichotomy. So long as obtaining or providing legal advice was one of the significant purposes of the internal investigation, the attorney **387 *759 privilege applies, even if there were also other purposes for the investigation and even if the investigation was mandated by regulation rather than simply an exercise of company discretion.\\nThe District Court began its analysis by reciting the \\u201cprimary purpose\\u201d test, which many courts (including this one) have used to resolve privilege disputes when attorney-client communications may have had both legal and business purposes. See id. at *2; see also In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98\\u201399. But in a key move, the District Court then said that the primary purpose of a communication is to obtain or provide legal advice only if the communication would not have been made \\u201cbut for\\u201d the fact that legal advice was sought. 2014 WL 1016784, at *2. In other words, if there was any other purpose behind the communication, the attorney-client privilege apparently does not apply. The District Court went on to conclude that KBR's internal investigation was \\u201cundertaken pursuant to regulatory law and corporate policy rather than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\\u201d Id. at *3; see id. at *3 n. 28 (citing federal contracting regulations). Therefore, in the District Court's view, \\u201cthe primary purpose of\\u201d the internal investigation \\u201cwas to comply with federal defense contractor regulations, not to secure legal advice.\\u201d United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., No. 1:05\\u2013cv\\u20131276, 4 F.Supp.3d 162, 166, 2014 WL 929430, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2014); see id. (\\u201cNothing suggests the reports were prepared to obtain legal advice. Instead, the reports were prepared to try to comply with KBR's obligation to report improper conduct to the Department of Defense.\\u201d).\\nThe District Court erred because it employed the wrong legal test. The but-for test articulated by the District Court is not appropriate for attorney-client privilege analysis. Under the District Court's approach, the attorney-client privilege apparently would not apply unless the sole purpose of the communication was to obtain or provide legal advice. That is not the law. We are aware of no Supreme Court or court of appeals decision that has adopted a test of this kind in this context. The District Court's novel approach to the attorney-client privilege would eliminate the attorney-client privilege for numerous communications that are made for both legal and business purposes and that heretofore have been covered by the attorney-client privilege. And the District Court's novel approach would eradicate the attorney-client privilege for internal investigations conducted by businesses that are required by law to maintain compliance programs, which is now the case in a significant swath of American industry. In turn, businesses would be less likely to disclose facts to their attorneys and to seek legal advice, which would \\u201climit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their client's compliance with the law.\\u201d Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 392, 101 S.Ct. 677. We reject the District Court's but-for test as inconsistent with the principle of Upjohn and longstanding attorney-client privilege law.\\nGiven the evident confusion in some cases, we also think it important to underscore that the primary purpose test, sensibly and properly applied, cannot and does not draw a rigid distinction between a legal purpose on the one hand and a business purpose on the other. After all, trying to find the one primary purpose for a communication motivated by two sometimes overlapping purposes (one legal and one business, for example) can be an inherently impossible task. It is often not useful or even feasible to try to determine whether the purpose was A or B when the purpose was A and B. It is thus not correct for a court to presume that a communication can have only one primary purpose **388 *760 It is likewise not correct for a court to try to find the one primary purpose in cases where a given communication plainly has multiple purposes. Rather, it is clearer, more precise, and more predictable to articulate the test as follows: Was obtaining or providing legal advice a primary purpose of the communication, meaning one of the significant purposes of the communication? As the Reporter's Note to the Restatement says, \\u201cIn general, American decisions agree that the privilege applies if one of the significant purposes of a client in communicating with a lawyer is that of obtaining legal assistance.\\u201d 1 Restatement \\u00a7 72, Reporter's Note, at 554. We agree with and adopt that formulation\\u2014\\u201cone of the significant purposes\\u201d\\u2014as an accurate and appropriate description of the primary purpose test. Sensibly and properly applied, the test boils down to whether obtaining or providing legal advice was one of the significant purposes of the attorney-client communication.\\n4\\nIn the context of an organization's internal investigation, if one of the significant purposes of the internal investigation was to obtain or provide legal advice, the privilege will apply. That is true regardless of whether an internal investigation was conducted pursuant to a company compliance program required by statute or regulation, or was otherwise conducted pursuant to company policy. Cf. Andy Liu et al., How To Protect Internal Investigation Materials from Disclosure, 56 Government Contractor \\u00b6 108 (Apr. 9, 2014) (\\u201cHelping a corporation comply with a statute or regulation\\u2014although required by law\\u2014does not transform quintessentially legal advice into business advice.\\u201d).\\nIn this case, there can be no serious dispute that one of the significant purposes of the KBR internal investigation was to obtain or provide legal advice. In denying KBR's privilege claim on the ground that the internal investigation was conducted in order to comply with regulatory requirements and corporate policy and not just to obtain or provide legal advice, the District Court applied the wrong legal test and clearly erred.\\nIII\\n5\\nHaving concluded that the District Court's privilege ruling constituted error, we still must decide whether that error justifies a writ of mandamus. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1651. Mandamus is a \\u201cdrastic and extraordinary\\u201d remedy \\u201creserved for really extraordinary causes.\\u201d Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (quoting Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259\\u201360, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947)). In keeping with that high standard, the Supreme Court in Cheney stated that three conditions must be satisfied before a court grants a writ of mandamus: (1) the mandamus petitioner must have \\u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires,\\u201d (2) the mandamus petitioner must show that his right to the issuance of the writ is \\u201cclear and indisputable,\\u201d and (3) the court, \\u201cin the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\\u201d Id. at 380\\u201381, 124 S.Ct. 2576 (quoting and citing Kerr v. United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). We conclude that all three conditions are satisfied in this case.\\nA\\n6\\n7\\nFirst, a mandamus petitioner must have \\u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.\\u201d Cheney, 542 U.S. at 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576. That initial requirement will often be met in cases where a petitioner claims that a district **389 *761 court erroneously ordered disclosure of attorney-client privileged documents. That is because (i) an interlocutory appeal is not available in attorney-client privilege cases (absent district court certification) and (ii) appeal after final judgment will come too late because the privileged communications will already have been disclosed pursuant to the district court's order.\\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that an interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine is not available in attorney-client privilege cases. See Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106\\u201313, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009); see also 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1291. To be sure, a party in KBR's position may ask the district court to certify the privilege question for interlocutory appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(b). But that avenue is available only at the discretion of the district court. And here, the District Court denied KBR's request for certification. See United States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., No. 1:05\\u2013cv\\u20131276, 4 F.Supp.3d 162, 165\\u201368, 2014 WL 929430, at *1\\u20133 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2014). It is also true that a party in KBR's position may defy the district court's ruling and appeal if the district court imposes contempt sanctions for non-disclosure. But as this Court has explained, forcing a party to go into contempt is not an \\u201cadequate\\u201d means of relief in these circumstances. See In re Sealed Case, 151 F.3d 1059, 1064\\u201365 (D.C.Cir.1998); see also In re City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 934 (2d Cir.2010) (same).\\nOn the other hand, appeal after final judgment will often come too late because the privileged materials will already have been released. In other words, \\u201cthe cat is out of the bag.\\u201d In re Papandreou, 139 F.3d 247, 251 (D.C.Cir.1998). As this Court and others have explained, post-release review of a ruling that documents are unprivileged is often inadequate to vindicate a privilege the very purpose of which is to prevent the release of those confidential documents. See id.; see also In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 129 (2d Cir.2008) (\\u201ca remedy after final judgment cannot unsay the confidential information that has been revealed\\u201d) (quoting In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 99 (2d Cir.1987)).\\nFor those reasons, the first condition for mandamus\\u2014no other adequate means to obtain relief\\u2014will often be satisfied in attorney-client privilege cases. Barko responds that the Supreme Court in Mohawk, although addressing only the availability of interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine, in effect also barred the use of mandamus in attorney-client privilege cases. According to Barko, Mohawk means that the first prong of the mandamus test cannot be met in attorney-client privilege cases because of the availability of post-judgment appeal. That is incorrect. It is true that Mohawk held that attorney-client privilege rulings are not appealable under the collateral order doctrine because \\u201cpostjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and ensure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.\\u201d 558 U.S. at 109, 130 S.Ct. 599. But at the same time, the Court repeatedly and expressly reaffirmed that mandamus\\u2014as opposed to the collateral order doctrine\\u2014remains a \\u201cuseful safety valve\\u201d in some cases of clear error to correct \\u201csome of the more consequential attorney-client privilege rulings.\\u201d Id. at 110\\u201312, 130 S.Ct. 599 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). It would make little sense to read Mohawk to implicitly preclude mandamus review in all cases given that Mohawk explicitly preserved mandamus review in some cases. Other appellate courts that have considered this question have agreed. See Hernandez v. Tanninen, 604 F.3d 1095, 1101 (9th Cir.2010); In re Whirlpool Corp., 597 F.3d 858, 860 (7th Cir.2010); see also **390 *762 In re Perez, 749 F.3d 849 (9th Cir.2014) (granting mandamus after Mohawk on informants privilege ruling); City of New York, 607 F.3d at 933 (same on law enforcement privilege ruling).\\nB\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nSecond, a mandamus petitioner must show that his right to the issuance of the writ is \\u201cclear and indisputable.\\u201d Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576. Although the first mandamus requirement is often met in attorney-client privilege cases, this second requirement is rarely met. An erroneous district court ruling on an attorney-client privilege issue by itself does not justify mandamus. The error has to be clear. As a result, appellate courts will often deny interlocutory mandamus petitions advancing claims of error by the district court on attorney-client privilege matters. In this case, for the reasons explained at length in Part II, we conclude that the District Court's privilege ruling constitutes a clear legal error. The second prong of the mandamus test is therefore satisfied in this case.\\nC\\n11\\n12\\nThird, before granting mandamus, we must be \\u201csatisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\\u201d Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576. As its phrasing suggests, that is a relatively broad and amorphous totality of the circumstances consideration. The upshot of the third factor is this: Even in cases of clear district court error on an attorney-client privilege matter, the circumstances may not always justify mandamus.\\nIn this case, considering all of the circumstances, we are convinced that mandamus is appropriate. The District Court's privilege ruling would have potentially far-reaching consequences. In distinguishing Upjohn, the District Court relied on a number of factors that threaten to vastly diminish the attorney-client privilege in the business setting. Perhaps most importantly, the District Court's distinction of Upjohn on the ground that the internal investigation here was conducted pursuant to a compliance program mandated by federal regulations would potentially upend certain settled understandings and practices. Because defense contractors are subject to regulatory requirements of the sort cited by the District Court, the logic of the ruling would seemingly prevent any defense contractor from invoking the attorney-client privilege to protect internal investigations undertaken as part of a mandatory compliance program. See 48 C.F.R. \\u00a7 52.203\\u201313 (2010). And because a variety of other federal laws require similar internal controls or compliance programs, many other companies likewise would not be able to assert the privilege to protect the records of their internal investigations. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 78m(b)(2), 7262; 41 U.S.C. \\u00a7 8703. As KBR explained, the District Court's decision \\u201cwould disable most public companies from undertaking confidential internal investigations.\\u201d KBR Pet. 19. As amici added, the District Court's novel approach has the potential to \\u201cwork a sea change in the well-settled rules governing internal corporate investigations.\\u201d Br. of Chamber of Commerce et al. as Amici Curaie 1; see KBR Reply Br. 1 n. 1 (citing commentary to same effect); Andy Liu et al., How To Protect Internal Investigation Materials from Disclosure, 56 Government Contractor \\u00b6 108 (Apr. 9, 2014) (assessing broad impact of ruling on government contractors).\\nTo be sure, there are limits to the impact of a single district court ruling because it is not binding on any other court or judge. But prudent counsel monitor court decisions closely and adapt their **391 *763 practices in response. The amicus brief in this case, which was joined by numerous business and trade associations, convincingly demonstrates that many organizations are well aware of and deeply concerned about the uncertainty generated by the novelty and breadth of the District Court's reasoning. That uncertainty matters in the privilege context, for the Supreme Court has told us that an \\u201cuncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all.\\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 393, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). More generally, this Court has long recognized that mandamus can be appropriate to \\u201c forestall future error in trial courts\\u201d and \\u201celiminate uncertainty\\u201d in important areas of law. Colonial Times, Inc. v. Gasch, 509 F.2d 517, 524 (D.C.Cir.1975). Other courts have granted mandamus based on similar considerations. See In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 129 (2d Cir.2008) (granting mandamus where \\u201cimmediate resolution will avoid the development of discovery practices or doctrine undermining the privilege\\u201d) (quotation omitted); In re Seagate Technology, LLC, 497 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2007) (en banc) (same). The novelty of the District Court's privilege ruling, combined with its potentially broad and destabilizing effects in an important area of law, convinces us that granting the writ is \\u201cappropriate under the circumstances.\\u201d Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576. In saying that, we do not mean to imply that all of the circumstances present in this case are necessary to meet the third prong of the mandamus test. But they are sufficient to do so here. We therefore grant KBR's petition for a writ of mandamus.\\nIV\\n13\\nWe have one final matter to address. At oral argument, KBR requested that if we grant mandamus, we also reassign this case to a different district court judge. See Tr. of Oral Arg. at 17\\u201319; 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2106. KBR grounds its request on the District Court's erroneous decisions on the privilege claim, as well as on a letter sent by the District Court to the Clerk of this Court in which the District Court arranged to transfer the record in the case and identified certain documents as particularly important for this Court's review. See KBR Reply Br.App. 142. KBR claims that the letter violated Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 21(b)(4), which provides that in a mandamus proceeding the \\u201ctrial-court judge may request permission to address the petition but may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so by the court of appeals.\\u201d\\n14\\nIn its mandamus petition, KBR did not request reassignment. Nor did KBR do so in its reply brief, even though the company knew by that time of the District Court letter that it complains about. Ordinarily, we do not consider a request for relief that a party failed to clearly articulate in its briefs. To be sure, appellate courts on rare occasions will reassign a case sua sponte. See Ligon v. City of New York, 736 F.3d 118, 129 & n. 31 (2d Cir.2013) (collecting cases), vacated in part, 743 F.3d 362 (2d Cir.2014). But whether requested to do so or considering the matter sua sponte, we will reassign a case only in the exceedingly rare circumstance that a district judge's conduct is \\u201cso extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment.\\u201d Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 551, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 107 (D.C.Cir.2001) (en banc). Nothing in the District Court's decisions or subsequent letter reaches that very high standard. Based on the record before us, we have no reason to doubt that the District Court will **392 *764 render fair judgment in further proceedings. We will not reassign the case.\\n* * *\\nIn reaching our decision here, we stress, as the Supreme Court did in Upjohn, that the attorney-client privilege \\u201conly protects disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney.\\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 395, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). Barko was able to pursue the facts underlying KBR's investigation. But he was not entitled to KBR's own investigation files. As the Upjohn Court stated, quoting Justice Jackson, \\u201cDiscovery was hardly intended to enable a learned profession to perform its functions ... on wits borrowed from the adversary.\\u201d Id. at 396, 101 S.Ct. 677 (quoting Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 515, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947) (Jackson, J., concurring)).\\nAlthough the attorney-client privilege covers only communications and not facts, we acknowledge that the privilege carries costs. The privilege means that potentially critical evidence may be withheld from the factfinder. Indeed, as the District Court here noted, that may be the end result in this case. But our legal system tolerates those costs because the privilege \\u201cis intended to encourage \\u2018full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice.\\u2019 \\u201d Swidler & Berlin v. United States, 524 U.S. 399, 403, 118 S.Ct. 2081, 141 L.Ed.2d 379 (1998) (quoting Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389, 101 S.Ct. 677).\\nWe grant the petition for a writ of mandamus and vacate the District Court's March 6 document production order. To the extent that Barko has timely asserted other arguments for why these documents are not covered by either the attorney-client privilege or the work-product protection, the District Court may consider such arguments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":63}],"source":["Kavanaugh.sample(3)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Kavanaugh.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tRaZR_QCe0zz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495588176,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":514,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"}},"outputId":"ecf60753-04e8-4f33-c257-d378c8e4626f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(95, 5)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":64}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pQXfKUhQzfy1"},"source":["### Dates"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"A1dBmlkvQ8W9"},"outputs":[],"source":["dates_20_23 = pd.read_excel('data/2020_2023_Dates.xlsx')\n","dates_20_23 = dates_20_23[['Date', 'Case']]\n","dates_20_23 = dates_20_23.rename(columns={'Date': 'date', 'Case': 'case_name'})"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### opinions"],"metadata":{"id":"qpdaYawdsg1d"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IP2Lk6EdOrA7"},"outputs":[],"source":["opinions_20_23 = pd.read_excel('data/2020-2023.xlsx')\n","opinions_20_23.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\n","opinions_20_23 = opinions_20_23.groupby(['type', 'author', 'case_name'])['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x)).reset_index()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qbcKZ-mgcyzF"},"outputs":[],"source":["opinions_20_23['author'] = opinions_20_23['author'].replace(['Kavanaugh ',\"Barret\",\"S\", \"PER CURIAM\"],[ 'Kavanaugh', \"Barrett\", \"Sotomayor\",\"per_curiam\"])\n","opinions_20_23['type'] = opinions_20_23['type'].replace(['Majority',\"Concur\",\"Dissent\", \"PER CURIAM\"],[ 'majority', \"concurring\", \"dissenting\",\"per_curiam\"])\n","opinions_20_23['author'] = opinions_20_23['author'].replace(['Gorsuch '], ['Gorsuch'])\n","opinions_20_23 = opinions_20_23[opinions_20_23.author!='Ginsburg']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":81},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710495134166,"user":{"displayName":"Rami Nasser","userId":"16517082241765987878"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"fjpr7vFJUXGr","outputId":"d6e5df40-6732-4178-9b19-c940b3b41165"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["           type     author                                          case_name  \\\n","213  dissenting  Sotomayor   Berger v.

Today, however, the Court holds\\nthat two leaders of the North Carolina General Assembly\\nare entitled to intervene as a matter of right to represent\\nthe State\\u2019s interest in defending the constitutionality of\\nNorth Carolina law, even though that interest is already\\nbeing ably pursued on the State\\u2019s behalf by an existing state\\nparty to the litigation. The Court\\u2019s decision is wrong for two\\nreasons. First, the Court goes astray by creating a pre-\\nsumption that a State is inadequately represented in fed-\\neral court unless whomever state law designates as a\\nState\\u2019s representative is allowed to intervene, even where\\nthe interests that the intervenors seek to represent are\\nidentical to those of an existing party. That presumption of\\ninadequacy improperly permits state law, as opposed to fed-\\neral law, to determine whether an existing party ade-\\nquately represents a particular interest. Second, the Court\\nerrs by implying that the attorney general\\u2019s defense of the\\nconstitutionality of the voting law at issue here fell below a\\nminimal standard of adequacy. I respectfully dissent.\\n_x000c_2            BERGER v. NORTH CAROLINA STATE\\n               CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP\\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\\n\\n                                I\\n   The underlying dispute in this case concerns the consti-\\ntutionality of North Carolina\\u2019s voter-identification law,\\nSenate Bill 824 (S. B. 824), enacted in 2018. The North Car-\\nolina State Conference of the NAACP (NAACP respond-\\nents) sued members of the North Carolina State Board of\\nElections (state respondents) and the Governor in Federal\\nDistrict Court, alleging that the law violated the Four-\\nteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and \\u00a72 of the Voting\\nRights Act by, among other things, discriminating against\\nBlack and Latino voters. The state attorney general ap-\\npeared as counsel to represent the Governor and state re-\\nspondents. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7114\\u20132 (2021)\\n(providing that the attorney general has a \\u201cduty\\u201d \\u201cto appear\\nfor the State\\u201d in any matter \\u201cin which the State may be a\\nparty or interested\\u201d and to \\u201crepresent all State depart-\\nments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or\\nother organized activities of the State\\u201d). NAACP respond-\\nents also filed a parallel challenge to S. B. 824 in state court.\\nSee Holmes v. Moore, No. 18\\u2013CV\\u201315292 (Super. Ct. Wake\\nCty., N. C.).\\n   Shortly after the federal suit was filed, Philip E. Berger,\\nthe president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and\\nTimothy K. Moore, the speaker of the North Carolina House\\nof Representatives (petitioners here), filed a motion to in-\\ntervene \\u201con behalf of the General Assembly.\\u201d App. 55. They\\nsought to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil\\nProcedure 24(a)(2), claiming a \\u201csignificantly protectable in-\\nterest in the validity of S.B. 824.\\u201d App. 61. Petitioners\\ncited, among other things, a state statute conferring upon\\nthem standing to intervene on behalf of the General Assem-\\nbly in cases challenging state law. Id., at 61\\u201362 (citing\\nN. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\u00a71\\u201372.2). In the alternative, petition-\\ners sought permissive intervention under Federal Rule of\\nCivil Procedure 24(b).\\n   The District Court denied the motion without prejudice,\\n_x000c_                    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022)                   3\\n\\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\\n\\nexplaining that petitioners lacked \\u201ca significantly protecta-\\nble interest in . . . defending the constitutionality of S.B.\\n824 sufficient to warrant a right to intervene under Rule\\n24(a)(2)\\u201d because the Governor and state respondents re-\\nmained in the suit and were adequately defending the chal-\\nlenged law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 168. The court also rea-\\nsoned that allowing petitioners to intervene would \\u201c \\u2018hinder,\\nrather than enhance, judicial economy\\u2019 \\u201d and would \\u201c \\u2018unnec-\\nessarily complicate and delay\\u2019 the various stages of this\\ncase,\\u201d including discovery, dispositive motions, and trial.\\nId., at 180. The court granted petitioners\\u2019 motion to partic-\\nipate in the suit as amici, however, and assured petitioners\\nthat they could renew their motion to intervene if the attor-\\nney general, as counsel for the existing state parties, \\u201cde-\\nclined to defend the lawsuit.\\u201d Id., at 157.1 Petitioners did\\nnot appeal. Shortly thereafter, the District Court granted\\nthe Governor\\u2019s motion to dismiss him from the suit. The\\nattorney general continued representing state respondents\\nin the litigation.\\n   Six weeks after the District Court denied their original\\nintervention motion, petitioners filed a renewed motion,\\nagain seeking both to intervene as a matter of right and\\npermissively. Petitioners primarily reiterated arguments\\nmade in their first motion for intervention, adding that this\\nCourt\\u2019s decision in Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-\\nHill, 587 U. S. ___ (2019), \\u201cclarified\\u201d the interests they\\nsought to represent. App. 159. They also asserted that the\\nattorney general\\u2019s conduct in the parallel state-court litiga-\\ntion, in which petitioners were codefendants, supported pe-\\ntitioners\\u2019 argument for intervention. Specifically, petition-\\ners argued that the attorney general moved to dismiss five\\nof six claims in the state-court litigation, but not the sixth;\\nfailed to defend against NAACP respondents\\u2019 motion for a\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n  1 Petitioners submitted an amicus brief supporting state respondents\\u2019\\n\\nopposition to NAACP respondents\\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\\n_x000c_4            BERGER v.

Id., at 164.\\n   The District Court again denied the motion, explaining\\nthat it was \\u201cabundantly clear that [state respondents are]\\nactively and adequately defending this lawsuit.\\u201d App. to\\nPet. for Cert. 189. The court recounted that state respond-\\nents had \\u201cconsistently \\u2018denied all substantive allegations of\\nunconstitutionality\\u2019 in this case\\u201d and had filed an \\u201cexpan-\\nsive\\u201d brief opposing NAACP respondents\\u2019 motion for a pre-\\nliminary injunction on the merits. Ibid. The court also re-\\njected petitioners\\u2019 argument that the attorney general\\u2019s\\nconduct in the pending state-court litigation was inade-\\nquate. The court explained that the attorney general\\u2019s de-\\ncision not to move to dismiss the sixth state-court claim in\\nthat separate litigation \\u201cfell well within the range of rea-\\nsonable litigation strategies\\u201d; that the attorney general se-\\ncured reversal of the state-court preliminary injunction on\\nappeal; and that the attorney general \\u201c \\u2018participated in ex-\\ntensive fact discovery\\u2019 \\u201d in the state-court litigation. Id., at\\n191, 192. The court therefore found \\u201cno sound basis on\\nwhich to speculate . . . that [state respondents] and [the]\\nAttorney General w[ould] abandon their duty to defend S.B.\\n824 in this case,\\u201d given that, by all appearances, they had\\nfully executed that duty in both the federal- and state-court\\nlitigation thus far. Id., at 193.\\n   The District Court also rejected petitioners\\u2019 request for\\npermissive intervention. In the court\\u2019s view, petitioners\\u2019\\ncontentions in the federal litigation, including their re-\\npeated skepticism of state respondents\\u2019 ability to defend\\nstate law vigorously, demonstrated that intervention\\n\\u201cwould only distract from the pressing issues in this case.\\u201d\\nId., at 193\\u2013194.\\n   Over a dissent by Judge Harris, the Court of Appeals va-\\ncated the District Court\\u2019s order and remanded for reconsid-\\neration of petitioners\\u2019 request to intervene. The Court of\\n_x000c_                  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022)              5\\n\\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\\n\\nAppeals voted to take the case en banc, however, and af-\\nfirmed the District Court\\u2019s denial of intervention.\\n   The en banc court began by stressing that its jurisdiction\\nwas limited to reviewing the order from which petitioners\\nhad chosen to appeal. Because petitioners had not appealed\\nthe District Court\\u2019s denial of their first intervention motion\\nseeking to \\u201crepresen[t] the General Assembly\\u2019s \\u2018institu-\\ntional interest\\u2019 in enforcement of S.B. 824,\\u201d the Court of Ap-\\npeals determined it could not review petitioners\\u2019 claim that\\nthey were representing that particular institutional inter-\\nest. \\n\\n999 F. 3d 915\\n\\n, 926 (CA4 2021). The en banc court in-\\nstead addressed petitioners\\u2019 argument that they were man-\\ndatorily entitled to represent the interest of the State in\\ndefending the constitutionality of S. B. 824.\\n   In its merits analysis, the en banc court observed that\\nRule 24(a)(2) contains several requirements, including that\\na proposed intervenor demonstrate both \\u201c \\u2018an interest in the\\nsubject matter of the action\\u2019 \\u201d and \\u201c \\u2018that the [proposed in-\\ntervenor\\u2019s] interest is not adequately represented by exist-\\ning parties to the litigation.\\u2019 \\u201d Id., at 927 (quoting Fed. Rule\\nCiv. Proc. 24(a)(2)). The court noted that petitioners had\\nnot asked the District Court and the Court of Appeals to\\nconsider whether state law was relevant to Rule 24(a)(2)\\u2019s\\nadequacy requirement, as opposed to its interest require-\\nment. See 999 F. 3d, at 930, n. 3. The court concluded that\\nN. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\u00a71\\u201372.2, the state statute authorizing\\npetitioners to intervene in cases challenging state law, bore\\non only the interest requirement. The court explained that\\n\\u201c[a] state\\u2019s policy judgment about the value of legislative in-\\ntervention may bestow a protectable interest in certain\\ncourt cases, but it does not override [a federal court\\u2019s] nor-\\nmal standards for evaluating the adequacy of existing rep-\\nresentation in those cases.\\u201d 999 F. 3d, at 929, n. 3 (empha-\\nsis added).\\n   The court assumed (as to the former requirement) that\\npetitioners had established a protectable interest in the\\n_x000c_6            BERGER v. NORTH CAROLINA STATE\\n               CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP\\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\\n\\nsubject matter of the litigation, but held (as to the latter\\nrequirement) that this \\u201cpurported interest in defending\\nS.B. 824 on behalf of the State of North Carolina\\u201d was \\u201cad-\\nequately represented by existing parties to the litigation.\\u201d\\nId., at 927. Accordingly, the court concluded that petition-\\ners had \\u201cno right to intervene in federal court under Rule\\n24(a)(2).\\u201d Ibid.\\n  This Court granted certiorari. 595 U. S. ___ (2021).\\n                                II\\n   At the heart of this case is Rule 24(a)(2), which governs\\nintervention as of right. As relevant here, Rule 24(a)(2) pro-\\nvides that a court \\u201cmust permit anyone to intervene\\u201d who,\\n(1) \\u201c[o]n timely motion,\\u201d (2) \\u201cclaims an interest relating to\\nthe property or transaction that is the subject of the action,\\nand is so situated that disposing of the action may as a prac-\\ntical matter impair or impede the movant\\u2019s ability to protect\\nits interest,\\u201d (3) \\u201cunless existing parties adequately repre-\\nsent that interest.\\u201d This case requires the Court to address\\nhow state laws affect mandatory intervention under Rule\\n24(a)(2).\\n   I begin with points of agreement: The Court and I agree\\nthat \\u201cStates may organize themselves in a variety of ways.\\u201d\\nAnte, at 9; see Bethune-Hill, 587 U.

Rather, Rule 24(a)(2) ex-\\nplicitly authorizes additional parties to intervene in pend-\\ning litigation only if their interests are not adequately\\nrepresented by an existing party.\\n   The Court instead concludes that the undisputed princi-\\nples discussed above establish a presumption that a State\\u2019s\\ninterests are not adequately represented \\u201cif [any of] its duly\\nauthorized representatives are excluded from participating\\nin federal litigation challenging state law.\\u201d Ante, at 9 (stat-\\ning that \\u201cfederal courts should rarely question that a State\\u2019s\\ninterests will be practically impaired or impeded\\u201d in these\\ncircumstances).

Neither\\npetitioners nor the Court identify a single precedent in\\nwhich a state actor was entitled to intervene as of right to\\ndefend a statute that another state actor already was de-\\nfending. Rather, the issue in all cases the Court cites was\\nwhether any state official would be allowed to defend a\\nState\\u2019s interest when an official charged with doing so de-\\nclined to do so. Cf.

To the\\ncontrary, it is well settled that the question whether an in-\\nterest is being \\u201cadequately represented\\u201d is one of federal law, not state law. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,\\nFederal Practice and Procedure \\u00a71905 (3d ed. Supp. 2022)\\n(Wright, Miller, & Kane) (citing cases and observing that\\n\\u201c[i]t is wholly clear that the right to intervene in a civil ac-\\ntion pending in a United States District Court is governed\\nby Rule 24 and not by state law\\u201d). Petitioners themselves,\\nuntil they arrived at this Court, never adopted the view\\nthat state law can supplant a federal court\\u2019s responsibility\\nto decide adequacy of representation in an individual case.\\n   The Court\\u2019s conclusion that state law can dictate what\\ncounts as \\u201cadequate\\u201d representation also suffers from prac-\\ntical infirmities. If state law can require a federal court to\\nallow a second state actor to intervene to represent a differ-\\nent \\u201cperspective,\\u201d ante, at 16, what is to stop a State from\\ndesignating 3, 4, or 10 or more officials as necessary parties\\nto suits challenging state law? The Court acknowledges\\nthis concern but offers no limiting principle grounded in\\nRule 24(a)(2). Ante, at 17. That is because it cannot: Under\\nthe Court\\u2019s logic, a federal court would have no choice but\\nto allow all 10 or more state officials to intervene.\\n   This result contravenes Rule 24(a)(2) and the practical\\nrealities of litigation that it reflects. Federal law gives dis-\\ntrict courts responsibility to assess, in the first instance, the\\nadequacy of a party\\u2019s representation because those courts\\nare most familiar with that representation and are respon-\\nsible for managing their dockets and streamlining proceed-\\nings. Rule 24(a)(2) thus does not require district courts to\\nallow intervention where interests are adequately repre-\\nsented because such intervention would be duplicative and\\ninefficient. This Rule accounts for the fact that mandatory\\nintervention imposes costs on the original parties, on the\\ncourt, and on all others whose interests depend on timely\\nresolution of a given case. Forcing federal courts \\u201cto accom-\\nmodate [a] cacophony of parties,\\u201d 999 F. 3d, at 934, as the\\nCourt\\u2019s logic today requires, will result in an \\u201cintractable\\nprocedural mess,\\u201d leaving district courts with \\u201cno basis for\\n_x000c_10              BERGER v.

Indeed, petitioners cannot now seek\\nto represent any unique interest of the General Assembly\\nin the litigation because they abandoned that argument by\\nfailing to appeal the District Court\\u2019s original order denying\\nintervention on that basis. By their own admission, then,\\npetitioners seek only to represent the State\\u2019s interest in de-\\nfending state law, an interest that state respondents al-\\nready represent.\\n  The Court insists that petitioners\\u2019 \\u201cperspective\\u201d never-\\ntheless differs from that of state respondents, by focusing\\non \\u201cdefending the law vigorously on the merits without an\\neye to crosscutting administrative concerns\\u201d such as obtain-\\ning guidance for the administration of upcoming elections.\\n_x000c_12             BERGER v.

The\\nCourt\\u2019s position rests in part on the assumption that lead-\\ners of the General Assembly have a unique interest that\\nshould be represented in the litigation. As noted, however,\\nthe case\\u2019s procedural posture forecloses that argument be-\\ncause petitioners forfeited it.4\\n   In any event, the difference in perspective the Court per-\\nceives boils down only to a disagreement over trial strategy.\\nAs the Court rightly concedes, the State has a strong inter-\\nest in the orderly administration of its elections. See ante,\\nat 16 (acknowledging state respondents\\u2019 interest in \\u201cstabil-\\nity and certainty\\u201d in an upcoming election). That is not,\\nhowever, the only state interest that state respondents, rep-\\nresented by the attorney general, sought to defend. The at-\\ntorney general has insisted all along that the interests he\\nseeks to represent, and indeed is required to represent un-\\nder state law, include defending the constitutionality of\\nNorth Carolina laws like the voter-identification law at is-\\nsue here. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7114\\u20132. These state\\ninterests are not mutually exclusive. The attorney gen-\\neral\\u2019s choice to emphasize the State\\u2019s interest in election ad-\\nministration at a particular stage of the litigation, while\\nsimultaneously maintaining a firm position on the consti-\\ntutionality of S. B. 824, was merely a choice about litigation\\nstrategy. It is a choice with which petitioners might disa-\\ngree, but it does not render state respondents\\u2019 representa-\\ntion inadequate.

But these are pre-\\ncisely the sort of strategic decisions that government attor-\\nneys make every day; in fact, petitioners themselves\\ndeclined to seek a stay in the parallel litigation in state\\ncourt. The Court\\u2019s retrospective criticism of the attorney\\ngeneral\\u2019s litigation strategy is insufficient to establish that\\nstate respondents inadequately represented the State\\u2019s in-\\nterests.

We conclude that the worker before us here cannot recover unless, and until, he manifests symptoms of a disease. We also consider a related claim for medical monitoring costs, and we hold, for reasons set out below, that the respondent in this case has not shown that he is legally entitled to recover those costs.\\n\\nI\\nRespondent, Michael Buckley, works as a pipefitter for Metro-North, a railroad. For three years (1985-1988) his job exposed him to asbestos for about one hour per working day. During that time Buckley would remove insulation from pipes, often covering himself with insulation dust that contained asbestos. Since 1987, when he attended an \\\"asbestos awareness\\\" class, Buckley has feared that he would develop cancer\\u0097and with some cause, for his two expert witnesses testified that, even after taking account of his nowdiscarded 15-year habit of smoking up to a pack of cigarettes per day, the exposure created an added risk of death due to cancer, or to other asbestos-related diseases, of either 1% to 5% (in the view of one of plaintiff's experts), or 1% to 3% (in the view of another). Since 1989, Buckley has received periodic medical checkups for cancer and asbestosis. So far, those checkups have not revealed any evidence of cancer or any other asbestos-related disease.\\nBuckley sued Metro-North under the FELA, a statute that permits a railroad worker to recover for an \\\"injury . . . resulting . . . from\\\" his employer's \\\"negligence.\\\" 45 U.S. C. \\u00a7 51. He sought damages for his emotional distress and to cover the cost of future medical checkups. His employer conceded negligence, but it did not concede that Buckley had actually suffered emotional distress, and it argued that the FELA did not permit a worker like Buckley, who had suffered no physical harm, to recover for injuries of either sort. *428 After hearing Buckley's case, the District Court dismissed the action. The court found that Buckley did not \\\"offer sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that he suffered a real emotional injury.\\\" App. 623. And, in any event, Buckley suffered no \\\"physical impact\\\"; hence any emotional injury fell outside the limited set of circumstances in which, according to this Court, the FELA permits recovery. Id., at 620; see Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532 (1994). The District Court did not discuss Buckley's further claim for the costs of medical monitoring.\\nBuckley appealed, and the Second Circuit reversed. 79 F.3d 1337 (1996). Buckley's evidence, it said, showed that his contact with the insulation dust (containing asbestos) was \\\"massive, lengthy, and tangible,\\\" id., at 1345, and that the contact \\\"would cause fear in a reasonable person,\\\" id., at 1344. Under these circumstances, the court held, the contact was what this Court in Gottshall had called a \\\"physical impact\\\"\\u0097a \\\"physical impact\\\" that, when present, permits a FELA plaintiff to recover for accompanying emotional distress. The Second Circuit also found in certain of Buckley's work place statements sufficient expression of worry to permit sending his emotional distress claim to a jury. Finally, the court held that Buckley could recover for the costs of medical checkups because the FELA permits recovery of all reasonably incurred extra medical monitoring costs whenever a \\\"reasonable physician would prescribe . . . a monitoring regime different than the one that would have been prescribed in the absence of\\\" a particular negligently caused exposure to a toxic substance. 79 F.3d, at 1347 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nWe granted certiorari to review the Second Circuit's holdings in light of Gottshall.\\n\\nII\\nThe critical question before us in respect to Buckley's \\\"emotional distress\\\" claim is whether the physical contact with insulation dust that accompanied his emotional distress *429 amounts to a \\\"physical impact\\\" as this Court used that term in Gottshall. In Gottshall, an emotional distress case, the Court interpreted the word \\\"injury\\\" in FELA \\u00a7 1, a provision that makes \\\"[e]very common carrier by railroad . . . liable in damages to any person suffering injury while . . . employed\\\" by the carrier if the \\\"injury\\\" results from carrier \\\"negligence.\\\" 45 U.S. C. \\u00a7 51. In doing so, it initially set forth several general legal principles applicable here. Gottshall described FELA's purposes as basically \\\"humanitarian.\\\" Gottshall, supra, at 542; see also, e. g., Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163 (1949). It pointed out that the Act expressly abolishes or modifies a host of common-law doctrines that previously had limited recovery. See, e. g., 45 U.S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 51, 53, and 54. It added that this Court has interpreted the Act's language \\\"liberally\\\" in light of its humanitarian purposes. Gottshall, supra, at 543. But, at the same time, the Court noted that liability under the Act rests upon \\\"negligence\\\" and that the Act does not make the railroad \\\"`the insurer' \\\" for all employee injuries. 512 U.S., at 543 (quoting Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329 U.S. 649, 653 (1947)). The Court stated that \\\"common-law principles,\\\" where not rejected in the text of the statute, \\\"are entitled to great weight\\\" in interpreting the Act, and that those principles \\\"play a significant role\\\" in determining whether, or when, an employee can recover damages for \\\"negligent infliction of emotional distress.\\\" 512 U.S., at 544. See also id., at 558 (Souter, J., concurring) (Court's duty \\\"in interpreting FELA . . . is to develop a federal common law of negligence . . . informed by reference to the evolving common law\\\"); Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U.S. 557 (1987).\\nThe Court also set forth several more specific legal propositions. It recognized that the common law of torts does not permit recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress unless the distress falls within certain specific categories that amount to recovery-permitting exceptions. The law, *430 for example, does permit recovery for emotional distress where that distress accompanies a physical injury, see, e. g., Simmons v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 678, 674 A.2d 232, 239 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Torts \\u00a7 924(a) (1977), and it often permits recovery for distress suffered by a close relative who witnesses the physical injury of a negligence victim, e. g., Dillon v. Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P.2d 912 (1968); Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 549, n. 10 (citing cases). The Court then held that FELA \\u00a7 1, mirroring the law of many States, sometimes permitted recovery \\\"for damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress,\\\" id., at 550, and, in particular, it does so where a plaintiff seeking such damages satisfies the common law's \\\"zone of danger\\\" test. It defined that test by stating that the law permits \\\"recovery for emotional injury\\\" by\\n\\\"those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant's negligent conduct, or who are placed in immediate risk of physical harm by that conduct.\\\" Id., at 547-548 (emphasis added).\\nThe case before us, as we have said, focuses on the italicized words \\\"physical impact.\\\" The Second Circuit interpreted those words as including a simple physical contact with a substance that might cause a disease at a future time, so long as the contact was of a kind that would \\\"cause fear in a reasonable person.\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1344. In our view, however, the \\\"physical impact\\\" to which Gottshall referred does not include a simple physical contact with a substance that might cause a disease at a substantially later time\\u0097 where that substance, or related circumstance, threatens no harm other than that disease-related risk.\\nFirst, Gottshall cited many state cases in support of its adoption of the \\\"zone of danger\\\" test quoted above. And in each case where recovery for emotional distress was permitted, the case involved a threatened physical contact that caused, or might have caused, immediate traumatic harm. *431 Keck v. Jackson, 122 Ariz. 114, 593 P.2d 668 (1979) (car accident); Towns v. Anderson, 195 Colo. 517, 579 P.2d 1163 (1978) (gas explosion); Robb v. Pennsylvania R.

Shein, 597 S.W.2d 141 (Ky. 1980) (holding that exposure to X rays was \\\"physical contact\\\" supporting recovery for emotional suffering where immediate physical harm to fetus was suspected).\\nSecond, Gottshall' s language, read in light of this precedent, seems similarly limited. 512 U.S., at 555 (\\\"zone of danger test . . . is consistent with FELA's central focus on physical perils\\\"); id., at 556 (quoting Lancaster v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 773 F.2d 807, 813 (CA7 1985)) (FELA seeks to protect workers \\\"`from physical invasions or menaces' \\\"), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 945 (1987); 512 U.S., at 556 (employer should be liable for \\\"emotional injury caused by the apprehension of physical impact\\\"); id., at 547-548 (quoting Pearson, Liability to Bystanders for Negligently Inflicted Emotional Harm\\u0097A Comment on the Nature of Arbitrary Rules, *432 34 U. Fla. L. Rev. 477, 488-489 (1982)) (\\\"`[T]hose within the zone of danger of physical impact' \\\" should be able to \\\"`recover for fright' \\\" because \\\"`a near miss may be as frightening as a direct hit' \\\").\\nTaken together, language and cited precedent indicate that the words \\\"physical impact\\\" do not encompass every form of \\\"physical contact.\\\" And, in particular, they do not include a contact that amounts to no more than an exposure\\u0097an exposure, such as that before us, to a substance that poses some future risk of disease and which contact causes emotional distress only because the worker learns that he may become ill after a substantial period of time.\\nThird, common-law precedent does not favor the plaintiff. Common-law courts do permit a plaintiff who suffers from a disease to recover for related negligently caused emotional distress, see supra, at 429, and some courts permit a plaintiff who exhibits a physical symptom of exposure to recover, see, e. g., Herber v. Johns-Manville Corp., 785 F.2d 79, 85 (CA3 1986); Mauro v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 225 N. J. Super. 196, 542 A.2d 16 (App. Div. 1988). But with only a few exceptions, common-law courts have denied recovery to those who, like Buckley, are disease and symptom free. E. g., Burns v. Jacquays Mining Corp., 156 Ariz. 375, 752 P.2d 28 (Ct. App. 1987), review dism'd, 162 Ariz. 186, 781 P.2d 1373 (1989); Mergenthaler v. Asbestos Corp. of Am., 480 A.2d 647 (Del. 1984); Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. Cox, 481 So. 2d 517 (Fla. App. 1985), review denied, 492 So. 2d 1331 (Fla. 1986); Capital Holding Corp. v. Bailey, 873 S.W.2d 187 (Ky. 1994); Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 437 N.E.2d 171 (1982); Simmons v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 674 A.2d 232 (1996); Ball v. Joy Technologies, Inc., 958 F.2d 36 (CA4 1991); Deleski v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 819 F.2d 377 (CA3 1987) (Pennsylvania and New Jersey law); Adams v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 783 F.2d 589 (CA5 1986) (Louisiana law); Wisniewski v. Johns-Manville Corp., 759 F.2d 271 (CA3 1985) (Pennsylvania law); In re Hawaii Federal  *433 Asbestos Cases, 734 F. Supp. 1563 (Haw. 1990) (Hawaii law); Amendola v. Kansas City So. R. Co., 699 F. Supp. 1401 (WD Mo. 1988) (FELA); see also Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965, 863 P.2d 795 (1993) (in banc) (no recovery for fear of cancer in a negligence action unless plaintiff is \\\"more likely than not\\\" to develop cancer).\\nFourth, the general policy reasons to which Gottshall referred\\u0097in its explanation of why common-law courts have restricted recovery for emotional harm to cases falling within rather narrowly defined categories\\u0097militate against an expansive definition of \\\"physical impact\\\" here. Those reasons include: (a) special \\\"difficult[y] for judges and juries\\\" in separating valid, important claims from those that are invalid or \\\"trivial,\\\" Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 557; (b) a threat of \\\"unlimited and unpredictable liability,\\\" ibid.; and (c) the \\\"potential for a flood\\\" of comparatively unimportant, or \\\"trivial,\\\" claims, ibid.\\nTo separate meritorious and important claims from invalid or trivial claims does not seem easier here than in other cases in which a plaintiff might seek recovery for typical negligently caused emotional distress. The facts before us illustrate the problem. The District Court, when concluding that Buckley had failed to present \\\"sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find . . . a real emotional injury,\\\" pointed out that, apart from Buckley's own testimony, there was virtually no evidence of distress. App. 623-625. Indeed, Buckley continued to work with insulating material \\\"even though. . . he could have transferred\\\" elsewhere, he \\\"continued to smoke cigarettes\\\" despite doctors' warnings, and his doctor did not refer him \\\"either to a psychologist or to a social worker.\\\" Id., at 624. The Court of Appeals reversed because it found certain objective corroborating evidence, namely, \\\"workers' complaints to supervisors and investigative bodies.\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1346. Both kinds of \\\"objective\\\" evidence\\u0097the confirming and disconfirming evidence\\u0097seem only indirectly related to the question at issue, the existence *434 and seriousness of Buckley's claimed emotional distress. Yet, given the difficulty of separating valid from invalid emotional injury claims, the evidence before us may typify the kind of evidence to which parties and the courts would have to look.\\nThe Court in Gottshall made a similar point: \\\"[T]esting for the `genuineness' of an injury alone . .. would be bound to lead to haphazard results. Judges would be forced to make highly subjective determinations concerning the authenticity of claims for emotional injury, which are far less susceptible to objective medical proof than are their physical counterparts. To the extent the genuineness test could limit potential liability, it could do so only inconsistently.\\\" 512 U.S., at 552.\\nAnd Justice Ginsburg, too, in her opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, seems to recognize this problem, for she would limit recovery in emotional injury cases to those who can show more objective evidence than simply having expressed fear and concern to supervisors. See post, at 445.\\nMore important, the physical contact at issue here\\u0097a simple (though extensive) contact with a carcinogenic substance\\u0097does not seem to offer much help in separating valid from invalid emotional distress claims. That is because contacts, even extensive contacts, with serious carcinogens are common. See, e. g., Nicholson, Perkel, & Selikoff, Occupational Exposure to Asbestos: Population at Risk and Projected Mortality\\u00971980-2030, 3 Am. J. Indust. Med. 259 (1982) (estimating that 21 million Americans have been exposed to work-related asbestos); U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1 Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens 71 (1994) (3 million workers exposed to benzene, a majority of Americans exposed outside the work place); Pirkle, et al., Exposure of the U S Population to Environmental Tobacco Smoke, 275 JAMA 1233, 1237 (1996) (reporting that 43% of *435 American children lived in a home with at least one smoker, and 37% of adult nonsmokers lived in a home with at least one smoker or reported environmental tobacco smoke at work). They may occur without causing serious emotional distress, but sometimes they do cause distress, and reasonably so, for cancer is both an unusually threatening and unusually frightening disease. See Statistical Abstract of United States 94 (1996) (23.5% of Americans who died in 1994 died of cancer); American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures\\u00971997, p. 1 (half of all men and one-third of all women will develop cancer). The relevant problem, however, remains one of evaluating a claimed emotional reaction to an increased risk of dying. An external circumstance\\u0097exposure\\u0097makes some emotional distress more likely. But how can one determine from the external circumstance of exposure whether, or when, a claimed strong emotional reaction to an increased mortality risk (say, from 23% to 28%) is reasonable and genuine, rather than overstated\\u0097particularly when the relevant statistics themselves are controversial and uncertain (as is usually the case), and particularly since neither those exposed nor judges or juries are experts in statistics? The evaluation problem seems a serious one.\\nThe large number of those exposed and the uncertainties that may surround recovery also suggest what Gottshall  called the problem of \\\"unlimited and unpredictable liability.\\\" Does such liability mean, for example, that the costs associated with a rule of liability would become so great that, given the nature of the harm, it would seem unreasonable to require the public to pay the higher prices that may result? Cf. Priest, The Current Insurance Crisis and Modern Tort Law, 96 Yale L. J. 1521, 1585-1587 (1987). The same characteristics further suggest what Gottshall called the problem of a \\\"flood\\\" of cases that, if not \\\"trivial,\\\" are comparatively less important. In a world of limited resources, would a rule permitting immediate large-scale recoveries for widespread emotional distress caused by fear of future disease *436 diminish the likelihood of recovery by those who later suffer from the disease? Cf. J. Weinstein, Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation 10-11, 141 (1995); Schuck, The Worst Should Go First: Deferral Registries in Asbestos Litigation, 15 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 541 (1992).\\nWe do not raise these questions to answer them (for we do not have the answers), but rather to show that general policy concerns of a kind that have led common-law courts to deny recovery for certain classes of negligently caused harms are present in this case as well. That being so, we cannot find in Gottshall' s underlying rationale any basis for departing from Gottshall' s language and precedent or from the current common-law consensus. That is to say, we cannot find in Gottshall' s language, cited precedent, other common-law precedent, or related concerns of policy a legal basis for adopting the emotional distress recovery rule adopted by the Court of Appeals.\\nBuckley raises several important arguments in reply. He points out, for example, that common-law courts do permit recovery for emotional distress where a plaintiff has physical symptoms; and he argues that his evidence of exposure and enhanced mortality risk is as strong a proof as an accompanying physical symptom that his emotional distress is genuine.\\nThis argument, however, while important, overlooks the fact that the common law in this area does not examine the genuineness of emotional harm case by case. Rather, it has developed recovery-permitting categories the contours of which more distantly reflect this, and other, abstract general policy concerns. The point of such categorization is to deny courts the authority to undertake a case-by-case examination. The common law permits emotional distress recovery for that category of plaintiffs who suffer from a disease (or exhibit a physical symptom), for example, thereby finding a special effort to evaluate emotional symptoms warranted in that category of cases\\u0097perhaps from a desire to make a *437 physically injured victim whole or because the parties are likely to be in court in any event. In other cases, however, falling outside the special recovery-permitting categories, it has reached a different conclusion. The relevant question here concerns the validity of a rule that seeks to redefine such a category. It would not be easy to redefine \\\"physical impact\\\" in terms of a rule that turned on, say, the \\\"massive, lengthy, [or] tangible\\\" nature of a contact that amounted to an exposure, whether to contaminated water, or to germladen air, or to carcinogen-containing substances, such as insulation dust containing asbestos. But, in any event, for the reasons we have stated, supra, at 430-436, we cannot find that the common law has done so.\\nBuckley also points to a series of common-law cases that he believes offer him support. Many of these cases, however, find that the plaintiff at issue fell within a category where the law already permitted recovery for emotional distress. E. g., Marchica v. Long Island R. Co., 31 F.3d 1197 (CA2 1994) (traumatic injury); Clark v. Taylor, 710 F.2d 4 (CA1 1983) (intentional infliction of harm); Laxton v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 639 S.W.2d 431, 433-434 (Tenn. 1982) (nuisance claim); Lavelle v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.,  30 Ohio Misc. 2d 11, 507 N.E.2d 476 (Ct. Common Pleas, Cayahoga Cty. 1987) (emotional distress damages sought by asbestosis-afflicted plaintiff). We have found only three asbestos-related cases, all involving state law, that support Buckley directly. Watkins v. Fibreboard Corp., 994 F.2d 253, 259 (CA5 1993) (Texas law) (recognizing cause of action for emotional distress based on exposures to asbestos in the absence of physical symptoms); In re Moorenovich, 634 F. Supp. 634 (Me. 1986) (Maine law) (same); Gerardi v. Nuclear Utility Services, Inc., 149 Misc. 2d 657, 566 N. Y. S. 2d 1002 (Westchester Cty. 1991) (same). None of them was decided by the highest court of the relevant State. And we do not find that minority view a sufficient basis for reaching Buckley's proposed conclusion.\\n*438 Finally, Buckley argues that the \\\"humanitarian\\\" nature of the FELA warrants a holding in his favor. We do not doubt that the FELA's purpose militates in favor of recovery for a serious and negligently caused emotional harm. Cf. Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 550. But just as courts must interpret that law to take proper account of the harms suffered by a sympathetic individual plaintiff, so they must consider the general impact, on workers as well as employers, of the general liability rules they would thereby create. Here the relevant question concerns not simply recovery in an individual case, but the consequences and effects of a rule of law that would permit that recovery. And if the common law concludes that a legal rule permitting recovery here, from a tort law perspective, and despite benefits in some individual cases, would on balance cause more harm than good, and if we find that judgment reasonable, we cannot find that conclusion inconsistent with the FELA's humanitarian purpose.\\n\\nIII\\nBuckley also sought recovery for a different kind of \\\"injury,\\\" namely, the economic cost of the extra medical checkups that he expects to incur as a result of his exposure to asbestos-laden insulation dust. The District Court, when it dismissed the action, did not discuss this aspect of Buckley's case. But the Second Circuit, when reversing the District Court, held that \\\"a reasonable jury could award\\\" Buckley the \\\"costs\\\" of \\\"medical monitoring\\\" in this case. 79 F.3d, at 1347. We agreed to decide whether the court correctly found that the FELA permitted a plaintiff without symptoms or disease to recover this economic loss.\\nThe parties do not dispute\\u0097and we assume\\u0097that an exposed plaintiff can recover related reasonable medical monitoring costs if and when he develops symptoms. As the Second Circuit pointed out, a plaintiff injured through negligence can recover related reasonable medical expenses as an element of damages. Ibid. (citing C. McCormick, Law of *439 Damages \\u00a7 90 (1935)); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts \\u00a7 924(c) (1977); J. Stein, Stein on Personal Injury Damages \\u00a7 5.18 (2d ed. 1991). No one has argued that any different principle would apply in the case of a plaintiff whose \\\"injury\\\" consists of a disease, a symptom, or those sorts of emotional distress that fall within the FELA's definition of \\\"injury.\\\" See Part II, supra. Much of the Second Circuit's opinion suggests it intended only to apply this basic principle of the law of damages. See, e. g., 79 F. 3d, at 1342 (\\\"[T]his case turns upon whether . . . emotional harm . . . is an injury compensable under FELA\\\"); id., at 1347 (monitoring costs are a \\\"traditional element of tort damages\\\"). Insofar as that is so, Part II of our opinion, holding that the emotional distress at issue here is not a compensable \\\"injury,\\\" requires reversal on this point as well.\\nOther portions of the Second Circuit's opinion, however, indicate that it may have rested this portion of its decision upon a broader ground, namely, that medical monitoring costs themselves represent a separate negligently caused economic \\\"injury,\\\" 45 U.S. C. \\u00a7 51, for which a negligently exposed FELA plaintiff (including a plaintiff without disease or symptoms) may recover to the extent that the medical monitoring costs that a reasonable physician would prescribe for the plaintiff exceed the medical monitoring costs that \\\"would have been prescribed in the absence of [the] exposure.\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1347 (citation omitted). This portion of the opinion, when viewed in light of Buckley's straightforward claim for an \\\"amount of money\\\" sufficient to \\\"compensate\\\" him for \\\"future medical monitoring expenses,\\\" Plaintiff's Proposed Charges to the Jury 25, Record, Doc. 33, suggests the existence of an ordinary, but separate, tort law cause of action permitting (as tort law ordinarily permits) the recovery of medical cost damages in the form of a lump sum, see Stein, supra, at \\u00a7\\u00a7 5.1 and 5.18, and irrespective of insurance, Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \\u00a7 920A(2). As so characterized, the Second Circuit's holding, in our *440 view, went beyond the bounds of currently \\\"evolving common law.\\\" Gottshall, supra, at 558 (Souter, J., concurring).\\nGuided by the parties' briefs, we have canvassed the state-law cases that have considered whether the negligent causation of this kind of harm (i. e., causing a plaintiff, through negligent exposure to a toxic substance, to incur medical monitoring costs) by itself constitutes a sufficient basis for a tort recovery. We have found no other FELA decisions. We have put to the side several cases that involve special recovery-permitting circumstances, such as the presence of a traumatic physical impact, or the presence of a physical symptom, which for reasons explained in Part II are important but beside the point here. See, e. g., Friends for All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 746 F.2d 816, 824-825 (CADC 1984) (traumatic impact); Hagerty v. L & L Marine Services, Inc., 788 F.2d 315, modified, 797 F.2d 256 (CA5 1986) (same); Simmons v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 674 A.2d 232 (1996) (physical symptom). We have noted that federal courts, interpreting state law, have come to different conclusions about the matter. Compare, e. g., In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F.2d 829 (CA3 1990) (Pennsylvania law), with Ball v. Joy Technologies, Inc., 958 F.2d 36 (CA4 1991) (West Virginia and Virginia law). And we have ended up focusing on several important State Supreme Court cases that have permitted recovery. Ayers v. Jackson, 106 N. J. 557, 525 A.2d 287 (1987); Hansen v. Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 858 P.2d 970 (Utah 1993); Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965, 863 P.2d 795 (1993); see also Burns v. Jacquays Mining Corp., 156 Ariz. 375, 752 P.2d 28 (App. 1987).\\nWe find it sufficient to note, for present purposes, that the cases authorizing recovery for medical monitoring in the absence of physical injury do not endorse a full-blown, traditional tort law cause of action for lump-sum damages\\u0097of the sort that the Court of Appeals seems to have endorsed here. Rather, those courts, while recognizing that medical monitoring costs can amount to a harm that justifies a tort *441 remedy, have suggested, or imposed, special limitations on that remedy. Compare Ayers, supra, at 608, 525 A.2d, at 314 (recommending in future cases creation of \\\"a courtsupervised fund to administer medical-surveillance payments\\\"); Hansen, supra, at 982 (suggesting insurance mechanism or court-supervised fund as proper remedy); Potter, supra, at 1010, n. 28, 863 P.2d, at 825, n. 28 (suggesting that a lump-sum damages award would be inappropriate); Burns, supra, at 381, 752 P.2d, at 34 (holding that lump-sum damages are not appropriate), with, e. g., Honeycutt v. Walden,  294 Ark. 440, 743 S.W.2d 809 (1988) (damages award for future medical expenses made necessary by physical injury are awarded as lump-sum payment); Rice v. Hill, 315 Pa. 166, 172 A. 289 (1934) (same); and Restatement (Second) of Torts \\u00a7 920A(2) (1977) (ordinarily fact that plaintiff is insured is irrelevant to amount of tort recovery). Cf. Weinstein, Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation, at 154. We believe that the note of caution, the limitations, and the expressed uneasiness with a traditional lump-sum damages remedy are important, for they suggest a judicial recognition of some of the policy concerns that have been pointed out to us here\\u0097 concerns of a sort that Gottshall identified.\\nSince, for example, the particular cancer-related costs at issue are the extra monitoring costs, over and above those otherwise recommended, their identification will sometimes pose special \\\"difficult[ies] for judges and juries.\\\" Gottshall,  512 U. S., at 557. Those difficulties in part can reflect uncertainty among medical professionals about just which tests are most usefully administered and when. Cf. Report of U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services xxvii, xxx\\u0097xxxi, xlvii\\u0097xcii (2d ed. 1996). And in part those difficulties can reflect the fact that scientists will not always see a medical need to provide systematic scientific answers to the relevant legal question, namely, whether an exposure calls for extra monitoring. Cf. App. 182 (testimony by Buckley's expert conceding that periodic colon cancer screening \\\"is recommended by the American *442 Cancer Society anyway\\\"); id., at 164 (testimony by Buckley's expert declining to rule out that periodic chest X rays would likely benefit smokers such as Buckley, even in the absence of asbestos exposure). Buckley's sole expert, then, was equivocal about the need for extra monitoring, and the defense had not yet put on its case.\\nMoreover, tens of millions of individuals may have suffered exposure to substances that might justify some form of substance-exposure-related medical monitoring. See supra,  at 434-435. (The dissent limits its class of potential plaintiffs to employees suing their employers, see post, at 454, but other exposed individuals who satisfy the Paoli test, see post, at 449-450, could sue\\u0097at common law.) And that fact, along with uncertainty as to the amount of liability, could threaten both a \\\"flood\\\" of less important cases (potentially absorbing resources better left available to those more seriously harmed, see supra, at 435-436) and the systemic harms that can accompany \\\"unlimited and unpredictable liability\\\" (for example, vast testing liability adversely affecting the allocation of scarce medical resources). The dissent assumes that medical monitoring is not a \\\"costly\\\" remedy, see post, at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted). But Buckley here sought damages worth $950 annually for 36 years; by comparison, of all claims settled by the Center for Claims Resolution, a group representing asbestos manufacturers, from 1988 until 1993, the average settlement for plaintiffs injured by asbestos was about $12,500, and the settlement for non malignant plaintiffs among this group averaged $8,810. See App. in Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, O. T. 1996, No. 96-270, p. 578.\\nFinally, a traditional, full-blown ordinary tort liability rule would ignore the presence of existing alternative sources of payment, thereby leaving a court uncertain about how much of the potentially large recoveries would pay for otherwise unavailable medical testing and how much would accrue to plaintiffs for whom employers or other sources (say, insurance now or in the future) might provide monitoring in any *443 event. Cf. 29 CFR \\u00a7 1910.1001(l) (1996) (requiring employers to provide medical monitoring for workers exposed to asbestos). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations (which the dissent cites) help to demonstrate why the Second Circuit erred: where state and federal regulations already provide the relief that a plaintiff seeks, creating a full-blown tort remedy could entail systemic costs without corresponding benefits. Nor could an employer necessarily protect itself by offering monitoring, see post, at 453-454, for that is not part of the rule of law that Justice Ginsburg would endorse\\u0097a rule that, if traditional, would, as we have noted, allow recovery irrespective of the presence of a \\\"collateral source\\\" of payment. See post, at 449.\\nWe do not deny important competing considerations\\u0097of a kind that may have led some courts to provide a form of liability. Buckley argues, for example, that it is inequitable to place the economic burden of such care on the negligently exposed plaintiff rather than on the negligent defendant. See, e. g., Ayers, 106 N. J., at 603-606, 525 A.2d, at 311-312; Potter, 6 Cal. 4th, at 1007-1009, 863 P.2d, at 824. He points out that providing preventive care to individuals who would otherwise go without can help to mitigate potentially serious future health effects of diseases by detecting them in early stages; again, whether or not this is such a situation, we may assume that such situations occur. And he adds that, despite scientific uncertainties, the difficulty of separating justified from unjustified claims may be less serious than where emotional distress is the harm at issue. See also Ayers, supra; Potter, supra.\\nWe do not deny that Justice Ginsburg paints a sympathetic picture of Buckley and his co-workers; this picture has force because Buckley is sympathetic and he has suffered wrong at the hands of a negligent employer. But we are more troubled than is Justice Ginsburg by the potential systemic effects of creating a new, full-blown, tort law cause of action\\u0097for example, the effects upon interests of other *444 potential plaintiffs who are not before the court and who depend on a tort system that can distinguish between reliable and serious claims on the one hand, and unreliable and relatively trivial claims on the other. See supra, at 438. The reality is that competing interests are at stake\\u0097and those interests sometimes can be reconciled in ways other than simply through the creation of a full-blown, traditional, tort law cause of action. Cf. post, at 454.\\nWe have not tried to balance these, or other, competing considerations here. We point them out to help explain why we consider the limitations and cautions to be important\\u0097 and integral\\u0097parts of the state-court decisions that permit asymptomatic plaintiffs a separate tort claim for medical monitoring costs. That being so, we do not find sufficient support in the common law for the unqualified rule of lumpsum damages recovery that is,at least arguably, before us here. And given the mix of competing general policy considerations, plaintiff's policy-based arguments do not convince us that the FELA contains a tort liability rule of that unqualified kind.\\nThis limited conclusion disposes of the matter before us. We need not, and do not, express any view here about the extent to which the FELA might, or might not, accommodate medical cost recovery rules more finely tailored than the rule we have considered.\\n\\nIV\\nFor the reasons stated, we reverse the determination of the Second Circuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\nJustice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.\\nThe Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) was enacted to facilitate recovery for rail workers who suffer injuries as a result of their employers' negligence. \\\"Congress intended *445 the creation of no static remedy, but one which would be developed and enlarged to meet changing conditions and changing concepts of industry's duty toward its workers.\\\" Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426, 432 (1958). Until recently, this Court accorded the FELA a notably \\\"liberal construction in order to accomplish [Congress'] objects.\\\" Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 180 (1949). Today's decision, however, continues the step-back approach taken in Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532 (1994). Even if the Gottshall decision supported the Court's rejection of Michael Buckley's claim for emotional distress, the Court's disposition of Buckley's medical monitoring claim marks a new and enigmatic departure from a once \\\"constant and established course.\\\" Urie, 337 U. S., at 181-182.\\nBuckley's extensive contact with asbestos particles in Grand Central's tunnels, as I comprehend his situation, constituted \\\"physical impact\\\" as that term was used in Gottshall. Nevertheless, I concur in the Court's judgment with respect to Buckley's emotional distress claim. In my view, that claim fails because Buckley did not present objective evidence of severe emotional distress. See Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U.S. 557, 566-567, n. 13 (1987) (\\\"severe emotional injury . . . has generally been required to establish liability for purely emotional injury\\\"); see also id., at 569, n. 18. Buckley testified at trial that he was angry at MetroNorth and fearful of developing an asbestos-related disease. However, he sought no professional help to ease his distress, and presented no medical testimony concerning his mental health. See 79 F.3d 1337, 1341 (CA2 1996). Under these circumstances, Buckley's emotional distress claim fails as a matter of law. Cf. Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 563-564, 566-567 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (describing as \\\"unquestionably genuine and severe\\\" emotional distress suffered by one respondent who had a nervous breakdown, and another who was hospitalized, lost weight, and had, inter alia, suicidal preoccupations, anxiety, insomnia, cold sweats, and nausea).\\n*446 Concerning medical monitoring, the Court of Appeals ruled that Buckley stated a triable claim for monitoring expenses made \\\"necessary because of his exposure to asbestos,\\\" expenses essential \\\"to ensure early detection and cure of any asbestos-related disease he develops.\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1347. I would not disturb that ruling.\\n\\nI\\nAs a pipefitter for Metro-North, Michael Buckley repaired and maintained the labyrinth of pipes in the steam tunnels of Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The pipes were surrounded by a white insulation material that Buckley and his co-workers had to remove to perform their jobs. Without any protective gear, the pipefitters would hammer, slice, and pull the insulation material, which broke apart as it was removed, scattering dust particles into the air. Fans used to mitigate the intense heat of the steam tunnels spread further dust from insulation pieces that had accumulated on tunnel floors. The dust coated Buckley's skin and clothing; he testified that he could taste the gritty insulation material as it entered his mouth and nose. The pipefitters would emerge from their work in the tunnels covered from head to toe with white dust; for this appearance, they were dubbed \\\"the snowmen of Grand Central.\\\"\\nThe insulation material covering Grand Central's pipes was made of asbestos, widely recognized as a carcinogen since the mid-1970's. Metro-North did not tell the pipefitters of, or provide protection against, the danger to which the workers were exposed until 1987, two years after Buckley started working in the steam tunnels. At an asbestos awareness class on August 31, 1987, Buckley and his coworkers learned of the asbestos in the pipe insulation and of the diseases asbestos exposure could cause. Buckley was then given a respirator and some instruction on the \\\"glove bag\\\" method of removing asbestos. He testified that his efforts to use the respirator and glove bag method proved frustrating: *447 the respirator fit poorly and slid down his face as he perspired in the intense heat of the steam tunnels; the plastic bags used to isolate the asbestos melted on the hot pipes, spilling out the material instead of containing it.\\nBuckley and as many as 140 other asbestos-exposed workers sought legal counsel after their complaints to MetroNorth management went unresolved. In the FELA action now before us, Buckley isserving as test plaintiff for the claims of all the exposed employees. Metro-North stipulated in the District Court that it had \\\"negligently exposed the plaintiff Michael Buckley to asbestos while he was working in Grand Central Terminal from June 1985 to the beginning of September 1987.\\\" App. 594 (Admitted and Stipulated Facts). \\\"[N]o later than 1986,\\\" Metro-North also conceded, \\\"[it] obtained actual notice of the presence of asbestos in Grand Central Terminal and notice of the hazard that working with or around asbestos posed to the health and welfare of its employees.\\\" Ibid. Metro-North further acknowledged that \\\"it exposed the plaintiff to asbestos without warning him that he was being exposed to asbestos and without training him how to safely handle and remove asbestos.\\\" Ibid. Prior to Metro-North's stipulation conceding negligence, the New York Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted a joint investigation, leading to these conclusions: Metro-North had \\\"seriously disregarded the health and safety of its workers\\\"; and the railroad's failings were \\\"particularly egregious\\\" because Metro-North was on notice of the asbestos problem as a result of complaints by its workers, a report by its own consultant, and inspections by the New York State Department of Labor. Id., at 614.\\n\\nII\\nBuckley asserted two claims for relief in his FELA-based complaint: first, he charged Metro-North with negligent infliction of emotional distress; second, he sought compensation *448 for the cost of future medical monitoring. The Court definitively rejects Buckley's first claim by holding that, under the FELA, a rail worker may not recover damages for emotional distress unless, and until, he manifests symptoms of a disease. See ante, at 427, 430. As to Buckley's second claim, however, the Court speaks tentatively. \\\"[T]he respondent in this case,\\\" we are told, \\\"has not shown that he is legally entitled to recover [medical monitoring] costs.\\\" Ante, at 427. \\\"[A]rguably,\\\" the Court explains, Buckley demands an \\\"unqualified rule of lump-sum damages recovery,\\\" ante, at 444, a rule for which the Court finds \\\"[in]sufficient support in the common law,\\\" ibid. The Court pointedly refrains, however, from \\\"express[ing] any view . . . about the extent to which the FELA might, or might not, accommodate medical cost recovery rules more finely tailored than\\\" a \\\"rule of [the] unqualified kind.\\\" Ibid. (emphasis in original).\\nIt is not apparent why (or even whether) the Court reverses the Second Circuit's determination on Buckley's second claim. The Court of Appeals held that a medical monitoring claim is solidly grounded, and this Court does not hold otherwise. Hypothesizing that Buckley demands lump-sum damages and nothing else, the Court ruminates on the appropriate remedy without answering the anterior question: Does the plaintiff have a claim for relief? Buckley has shown that Metro-North negligently exposed him to \\\"extremely high levels of asbestos,\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1341, and that this exposure warrants \\\"medical monitoring in order to detect and treat [asbestos-related] diseases as they may arise.\\\" Id., at 1346. Buckley's expert medical witness estimated the annual costs of proper monitoring at $950. Ibid.[1] We do not know from the Court's opinion what more a plaintiff must show to qualify for relief.\\n\\n\\n*449 A\\nIn my view, the Second Circuit rightly held that a railworker negligently exposed to asbestos states a claim for relief under the FELA; recovery in such cases, again as the Court of Appeals held, should reflect the difference in cost between the medical tests a reasonable physician would prescribe for unexposed persons and the monitoring regime a reasonable physician would advise for persons exposed in the way Michael Buckley and his co-workers were. See id., at 1347; see infra, at 450-451 (defining an asbestos-exposed worker's \\\"injury\\\"); see also In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F.2d 829, 849-852 (CA3 1990) (Paoli I), cert. denied sub nom. General Elec. Co. v. Knight, 499 U.S. 961 (1991); In re Paoli R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35 F.3d 717, 785-788 (CA3 1994) (Paoli II), cert. denied sub nom. General Elec. Co. v. Ingram, 513 U.S. 1190 (1995).\\nRecognizing such a claim would align the FELA with the \\\"evolving common law.\\\" Gottshall, 512 U. S.,at 558 (Souter, J.,concurring). \\\"[A medical monitoring] action has been increasingly recognized by state courts as necessary given the latent nature of many diseases caused by exposure to hazardous materials and the traditional common law tort doctrine requirement that an injury be manifest.\\\" Daigle  v. Shell Oil Co., 972 F.2d 1527, 1533 (CA10 1992); see also Schwartz, Recovery of Damages for Expense of Medical Monitoring to Detect or Prevent Future Disease or Condition, 17 A. L. R. 5th 327 (1994). As the Court understates, several state high courts have upheld medical monitoring cost recovery. See ante, at 440. In a path marking opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, interpreting Pennsylvania law, recognized a right to compensation for monitoring \\\"necessary in order to diagnose properly the warning signs of disease.\\\" See Paoli I, 916 F. 2d, at 851; see also Paoli II, 35 F. 3d, at 785-788. Similarly, a number of Federal District Courts interpreting state law, and several state courts of first and second instance, have *450 sustained medical monitoring claims.[2] This Court, responsible for developing FELA law, finds little value in these decisions.\\nThese courts have answered the question this Court passes by: What are the elements of a compensable medical monitoring claim? The Third Circuit, for example, has enumerated: A plaintiff can recover the costs of medical monitoring if (1) he establishes that he was significantly exposed to a proven hazardous substance through the negligent actions of the defendant; (2) as a proximate result of the exposure, the plaintiff suffers a significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease; (3) by reason of the exposure a reasonable physician would prescribe a monitoring regime different from the one that would have been prescribed in the absence of the exposure; and (4) monitoring and testing procedures exist that make the early detection and treatment of the disease possible and beneficial. See Paoli I, 916 F. 2d, at 852; Paoli II, 35 F. 3d, at 788. Each factor must be shown by competent expert testimony. See Paoli I, 916 F. 2d, at 852.\\nA claim so defined comports with the terms of the FELA. Under the FELA, a railroad \\\"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury . . . resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.\\\" 45 U.S. C. \\u00a7 51. The \\\"injury\\\" sustained by an asbestos-exposed worker seeking to recover medical monitoring costs is the invasion of that employee's interest in being free from the economic burden of extraordinary *451 medical surveillance. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \\u00a7 7 (1964) (defining injury as \\\"the invasion of any legally protected interest of another\\\"); see Friends for All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 746 F.2d 816, 826 (CADC 1984) (\\\"It is difficult to dispute that an individual has an interest in avoiding expensive diagnostic examinations just as he or she has an interest in avoiding physical injury.\\\"); Ayers v. Jackson, 106 N. J. 557, 591, 525 A.2d 287, 304 (1987).\\nTraditional tort principles upon which the FELA rests warrant recognition of medical monitoring claims of the kind Buckley has asserted. As the Third Circuit explained, \\\"[t]he policy reasons for recognizing this tort are obvious[:]\\\"\\n\\\"Medical monitoring claims acknowledge that, in a toxic age, significant harm can be done to an individual by a tortfeasor, notwithstanding latent manifestation of that harm. Moreover, . . . recognizing this tort does not require courts to speculate about the probability of future injury. It merely requires courts to ascertain the probability that the far less costly remedy of medical supervision is appropriate. Allowing plaintiffs to recover the cost of this care deters irresponsible discharge of toxic chemicals by defendants and encourages plaintiffs to detect and treat their injuries as soon as possible. These are conventional goals of the tort system . . . .\\\" Paoli I,  916 F. 2d, at 852.\\nSee also Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965, 1008, 863 P.2d 795, 824 (1993); Hansen v. Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 858 P.2d 970, 976-978 (Utah 1993); Ayers, 106 N. J., at 603-605, 525 A.2d, at 311-312; Burns v. Jaquays Mining Corp., 156 Ariz. 375, 380-381, 752 P.2d 28, 33-34 (App. 1987).\\nOn all counts\\u0097exposure, increased risk of devastating disease, and the necessity of monitoring\\u0097Michael Buckley's complaint presents a textbook case. Through its stipulations, *452 Metro-North has acknowledged that it failed \\\"to use [the] reasonable care [the FELA requires] in furnishing its employees with a safe place to work.\\\" Buell, 480 U. S., at 558. At trial, \\\"[c]ompetent expert testimony . . . established both that Buckley suffered a substantial impact from asbestos that .. . significantly increased his risk of contracting an asbestos-related disease and that Buckley should receive medical monitoring in order to ensure early detection and cure of any asbestos-related disease he develops.\\\" 79 F.3d, at 1347. Thus, Metro-North, \\\"through [its] negligence, caused the plaintiff, in the opinion of medical experts, to need specific medical services\\u0097a cost that is neither inconsequential nor of a kind the community generally accepts as part of the wear and tear of daily life. Under [the] principles of tort law, the [tortfeasor] should pay.\\\" Friends for All Children,  746 F. 2d, at 825.\\n\\nB\\nThe Court, as I read its opinion, leaves open the question whether Buckley may state a claim for relief under the FELA. The Court does not question the medical need for monitoring. It recognizes that cancer, one of the diseases Buckley faces an increased risk of suffering, is \\\"unusually threatening and unusually frightening,\\\" ante, at 435, and that detection of disease in early stages \\\"can help to mitigate potentially serious future health effects,\\\" ante, at 443. On the other hand, the Court notes there may be \\\"uncertainty among medical professionals about just which tests are most usefully administered and when.\\\" Ante, at 441.\\nIt is not uncommon, of course, that doctors will agree that medical attention is needed, yet disagree on what monitoring or treatment course is best. But uncertainty as to which tests are best or when they should be administered is not cause to deny a claim for relief. Fact triers in tort cases routinely face questions lacking indubitably clear answers: Did defendant's product cause plaintiff's disease? What will plaintiff's future disability and medical costs be? It bears repetition, moreover, that recovery on a FELA medical monitoring *453 claim would be limited to the incremental cost of tests a reasonable physician would recommend as a result of the plaintiff's exposure. See 79 F.3d, at 1347.\\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations governing permissible levels of asbestos exposure in the work place make it plain that medical monitoring is no \\\"trivial\\\" matter, see ante, at 444; the regulations are instructive on appropriate standards for necessary monitoring, see 29 CFR \\u00a7 1910.1001 (1996); see also 29 U.S. C. \\u00a7 655(b)(7) (authorizing Secretary of Labor to require employers to provide medical monitoring to employees exposed to hazardous substances). OSHA's regulations direct employers to provide medical monitoring for employees exposed to certain levels of asbestos, and they describe in detail the monitoring employers must make available. See 29 CFR \\u00a7 1910.1001(l ), App. D, App. E (1996). These regulations apply to all industries covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act). Although the Act does not apply to state public employers such as Metro-North, see 29 U.S. C. \\u00a7 652(5), New York State has adopted OSHA standards for its public employers, see N. Y. Lab. Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 27\\u0097 a(3)(c), (4)(a) (McKinney 1986 and Supp. 1997). Had MetroNorth assiduously attended to those standards, Buckley might have been spared the costs he now seeks to recover.[3]\\nFinally, the Court's anticipation of a \\\"`flood' of less important cases\\\" and \\\"`unlimited and unpredictable liability' \\\" is overblown. See ante, at 442. The employee's \\\"injury\\\" in the claim at stake is the economic burden additional medical *454 surveillance entails, see supra, at 450-451; if an employer provides all that a reasonable physician would recommend for the exposed employee, the employee would incur no costs and hence have no claim for compensation. Nor does the FELA claim Buckley states pave the way for \\\"tens of millions of individuals\\\" with similar claims. See ante, at 442. It is doubtful that many legions in the universe of individuals ever exposed to toxic material could demonstrate that their employers negligently exposed them to a known hazardous substance, and thereby substantially increased the risk that they would suffer debilitating or deadly disease.[4] Withholding relief, moreover, is dangerous, for lives will be lost when grave disease is diagnosed too late.\\n\\nC\\nThe Court emphasizes most heavily that several courts, while authorizing recovery for medical monitoring, have imposed or suggested special limitations on the tort remedy. See ante, at 440-441. In lieu of lump-sum damages, the Court indicates, a court-supervised fund might be the better remedy. See ante, at 441; see also Potter, 6 Cal. 4th, at 1006-1010, and n. 28, 863 P.2d, at 821-825, and n. 28 (recognizing claim and affirming award for medical monitoring; suggesting in footnote creation of court-supervised fund); Hansen, 858 P. 2d, at 979-982 (reversing grant of summary judgment and recognizing claim for medical monitoring; suggesting creation of court-supervised fund); Ayers, 106 N. J., at 607-611, 525 A.2d, at 313-315 (affirming damages award for medical monitoring; suggesting creation of court-supervised fund in future cases); Burns, 156 Ariz., at 380-381, 752 P.2d, at 33-34 (recognizing claim for medical monitoring; holding plaintiffs entitled to award from court-supervised fund).\\nIt is scarcely surprising that the Second Circuit did not consider relief through a court-supervised fund. So far as the record before us shows, no party argued in the District *455 Court, the Second Circuit, or even this Court, that medical monitoring expenses may be recoverable, but not through a lump sum, only through a court fund. The question aired below was the prime one the Court obscures: Does Buckley's medical monitoring claim warrant any relief?\\nBuckley sought \\\"an `amount of money' sufficient to `compensate' him for `future medical monitoring expenses.' \\\" See ante, at 439. He was not more precise about the form relief should take. The Court infers from Buckley's proposed charges to the jury, however, that he wanted what \\\"tort law ordinarily permits\\\"\\u0097damages in a lump sum. See ibid. I believe his claim qualifies for that relief. If the Court deems what \\\"tort law ordinarily permits\\\" inappropriate, however, the Court should at least say, for the guidance of lower courts, \\\"Yes, Buckley has a claim for relief.\\\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) directs a court to grant the relief to which a prevailing party is entitled, even if the party did not demand such relief in its pleadings. Rule 54(c) thus instructs district courts to \\\"compensate the parties or remedy the situation without regard to the constraints of the antiquated and rigid forms of action.\\\" 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 2662, pp. 133-134 (2d ed. 1983). Under the Federal Rules, \\\"a party should experience little difficulty in securing a remedy other than that demanded in his pleadings when he shows he is entitled to it.\\\" Id., at 135; see also id., \\u00a7 2664, at 163 (Rule 54(c) \\\"has been utilized when the court awards a different type of relief from that demanded in the complaint\\\"); cf. Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 65-66 (1978) (\\\"a federal court should not dismiss a meritorious constitutional claim because the complaint seeks one remedy rather than another plainly appropriate one\\\") (citing Rule 54(c)).\\n\\n* * *\\nThe Court today reverses the Second Circuit's determination that Buckley has stated a claim for relief, but remands the case for further proceedings. If I comprehend the Court's enigmatic decision correctly, Buckley may replead a *456 claim for relief and recover for medical monitoring, but he must receive that relief in a form other than a lump sum. Unaccountably, the Court resists the straightforward statement that would enlighten courts in this and similar cases: A claim for medical monitoring is cognizable under the FELA; it is a claim entirely in step with \\\"`evolving common law.' \\\" See ante, at 440 (citing Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 558 (Souter, J., concurring)). I therefore dissent from the Court's judgment to the extent it relates to medical monitoring.\\n\",\n          \"While I did not join the three Justices who dissented in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988), I also declined to join the majority opinion because I was convinced then, and remain convinced today, that \\\"there may well be cases in which the defendant is unable to prove that the State acted in bad faith but in which the loss or destruction of evidence is nonetheless so critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair.\\\" Id., at 61 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).[*] This, like Youngblood, is not such a case.\\n*550 Neither is it a case that merited review in this Court, however. The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court has limited precedential value, and may well be reinstated on remand because the result is supported by the state-law holding in People v. Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N.E.2d 288 (1995). See ante, n. In my judgment the State's petition for a writ of certiorari should have been denied.\\n\",\n          \"Like THE CHIEF JUSTICE, I would have remanded this\\ncase to the lower courts to determine, under the proper\\nstandard, whether Wellness\\u2019 alter-ego claim is a Stern\\nclaim.

I write\\nseparately to highlight a few questions touching on the\\nconsent issue that merit closer attention than either the\\nCourt or THE CHIEF JUSTICE gives them.\\n  I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that individuals cannot\\nconsent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle\\nhas nothing to do with whose interest the violated provi-\\nsion protects. Anytime the Federal Government acts in a\\nmanner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts\\nin excess of its constitutional authority. That authority is\\ncarefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through\\nArticle V\\u2019s amendment process, that document does not\\npermit individuals to bestow additional power upon the\\nGovernment.\\n  The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to\\nadjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to\\nrequire an exercise of the judicial power based on its as-\\nsessment that few \\u201cstructural interests\\u201d are implicated by\\nconsent to the adjudication of Stern claims.

Worse, amidst the tempest over whether\\n\\u201cstructural interests\\u201d are implicated when an individual\\nconsents to adjudication of Stern claims by a non-Article\\nIII court, both the majority and THE CHIEF JUSTICE fail to\\ngrapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation\\nof the Constitution has actually occurred. That question is\\na difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by\\nskipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether\\nconsent can authorize a constitutional violation. Because\\nI would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not\\ndecide that question here. I nevertheless write separately\\nto highlight the complexity of the issues the majority\\nsimply brushes past.\\n                             I\\n\\n                             A\\n\\n   \\u201cThe principle, that [the Federal Government] can\\nexercise only the powers granted to it, . . . is now univer-\\nsally admitted.\\u201d McCulloch v.

Consent to\\nadjudication by non-Article III judges may waive whatever\\nindividual right to impartial adjudication Article III im-\\nplies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Govern-\\nment action.

Mortgage Bankers Assn., ante, at 5\\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\\n                              II\\n  Properly understood, then, the answer to the consent\\nquestion in this case depends on whether bankruptcy\\ncourts act within the bounds of their constitutional au-\\nthority when they adjudicate Stern claims with the con-\\nsent of the parties. In order to answer that question, we\\nmust consider what form of governmental power that type\\nof adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts\\nare qualified to exercise that power. Department of\\nTransportation v. Association of American Railroads, ante,\\nat 24 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\\n  Many Government functions \\u201cmay be performed by two\\nor more branches without either exceeding its enumerated\\npowers under the Constitution.\\u201d Ante, at 4. Certain core\\nfunctions, however, demand the exercise of legislative,\\nexecutive, or judicial power, and their allocation is con-\\ntrolled by the Vesting Clauses contained in the first three\\narticles of the Constitution. Ibid. We have already held\\nthat adjudicating Stern claims, at least without consent of\\nthe parties, requires an exercise of the judicial power\\nvested exclusively in Article III courts. Stern, 564 U. S., at\\n___\\u2013___ (slip op., at 28\\u201329). The difficult question pre-\\nsented by this case, which the Court glosses over, is\\nwhether the parties\\u2019 consent somehow transforms the\\nnature of the power exercised.\\n                         A\\n  As the concepts were understood at the time of the\\n6        WELLNESS INT\\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

In this context, the judicial power is the power\\n\\u201cto determine all differences according to the established\\nlaw\\u201d; the legislative power is the power to make that\\n\\u201cestablished law\\u201d; and the executive power is the power \\u201cto\\nback and support the sentence, and to give it due execu-\\ntion.\\u201d J.

Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825).\\n   It should be immediately apparent that consent does not\\ntransform the adjudication of Stern claims into a function\\nthat requires the exercise of legislative or executive power.\\nParties by their consent do not transform the function of\\nadjudicating controversies into the functions of creating\\nrules or enforcing judgments.\\n   The more difficult question is whether consent somehow\\neliminates the need for an exercise of the judicial power.\\nOur precedents reveal that the resolution of certain cases\\nor controversies requires the exercise of that power, but\\nthat others \\u201cmay or may not\\u201d be brought \\u201cwithin the cog-\\nnizance of [Article III courts], as [Congress] deem[s] proper.\\u201d\\nMurray\\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18\\nHow. 272, 284 (1856). The distinction generally has to\\ndo with the types of rights at issue. Disposition of private\\nrights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of\\nthe judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights\\ndoes not. From that core of the judicial power, we have\\nidentified two narrow historical exceptions. Those excep-\\ntions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies\\nnot falling within that core, provide useful guidance for\\nunderstanding whether bankruptcy courts\\u2019 adjudication of\\nStern claims with the consent of the parties requires the\\nexercise of Article III judicial power.\\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

Lawson, Territo-\\nrial Governments and the Limits of Formalism, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 853, 892\\n(1990) (criticizing it as \\u201cfatuous\\u201d dictum). On the one hand, some early\\nevidence suggests that the courts were thought to be dealing primarily\\nwith local matters that lie beyond federal judicial cognizance. Pfander,\\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the\\nUnited States, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 706\\u2013711 (2004). Yet Canter\\ninvolved a controversy indisputably capable of adjudication by Article\\nIII courts, because it both arose in admiralty and fell within the Su-\\npreme Court\\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Pfander, supra, at 713\\u2013714, n.\\n314. The best explanation for this apparent tension is that territorial\\ncourts adjudicate matters that Congress may or may not assign to\\nArticle III courts, as it wishes. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political\\nBranches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 575\\u2013576 (2007). To recognize\\nCongress\\u2019 discretion requires no distortion of the meaning of judicial\\npower because Chief Justice Marshall\\u2019s reasoning has nothing to do\\nwith the intrinsic qualities of the adjudication itself\\u2014e.g., whether it\\ninvolves \\u201cthe stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the\\n8         WELLNESS INT\\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 78\\u201379\\n(1858). Whatever their historical validity, these prece-\\ndents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the\\nland and naval forces from Article III because of other\\nprovisions of the Constitution, not because of the defini-\\ntion of judicial power in Article III itself.

Unlike the other two categories, which reflect\\ncarve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-\\ngory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has\\nmore to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.\\n   The distinction between disputes involving \\u201cpublic\\nrights\\u201d and those involving \\u201cprivate rights\\u201d is longstand-\\ning, but the contours of the \\u201cpublic rights\\u201d doctrine have\\nbeen the source of much confusion and controversy.

Those Clauses were under-\\nstood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts\\nalone could act to deprive individuals of private rights\\nbecause the power to act conclusively against those rights\\nwas the core of the judicial power.

By contrast, a party who sought to\\nprotect only a \\u201cpublic right\\u201d in the land had no such vested\\nright and could not invoke the intervention of Article III\\ncourts.

See B&B Hardware, ante, at 9\\u201310, 12.\\nThe source of the confusion may be Murray\\u2019s Lessee\\u2014the\\nputative source of the public rights doctrine itself.

J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing\\nthe bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article\\nIII judges). Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudi-\\ncate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest\\nhistorical counterparts. And this Court has remained\\ncarefully noncommittal about the source of their authority\\nto do so. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U.S., at 71 (plurality\\nopinion).\\n  Applying the historical categories of cases discussed\\nabove, one can understand why. Bankruptcy courts clearly\\ndo not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but\\nthey are not an easy fit in the \\u201cpublic rights\\u201d category,\\neither. No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve\\nrights lying outside the core of the judicial power. The\\nmost obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a\\nparty may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.\\nIbid. Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together\\nwith the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can\\nact conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor\\u2019s\\ncreditors. We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that\\nthe claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy\\ncourt, as can any matter that would necessarily be re-\\nsolved by that process, even one that affects core private\\nrights. Stern, 564 U. S., at ___\\u2013___ (slip op., at 30\\u201331).\\nFor this reason, bankruptcy courts and their prede-\\n14       WELLNESS INT\\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v.

This means that, if their adjudica-\\ntion requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only\\nArticle III courts may perform it.\\n   Although Stern claims indisputably involve private\\nrights, the \\u201cpublic rights\\u201d doctrine suggests a way in\\nwhich party consent may transform the function of adjudi-\\ncating Stern claims into one that does not require the\\nexercise of the judicial power. The premise of the \\u201cpublic\\nrights\\u201d doctrine, as described above, is not that public\\nrights affirmatively require adjudication by some other\\ngovernmental power, but that the Government has a freer\\nhand when private rights are not at issue. Accordingly,\\nthis premise may not require the presence of a public right\\nat all, but may apply equally to any situation in which\\nprivate rights are not asserted.\\n   Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that\\n\\u201cprivate rights\\u201d bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the\\nbar imposed by the right to a jury trial. Individuals may\\ndispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial\\nintervention. A party who consents to adjudication of a\\nStern claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a\\nconditional surrender of whatever private right he has on\\nthe line, contingent on some future event\\u2014namely, that\\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

Indeed, it is on\\nthis logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted\\nprivate settlement of disputes, including through the\\naction of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.\\nSee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring\\nin judgment); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399\\n(1868). Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the\\nrelationship between private rights and the judicial power\\nhave emphasized the \\u201cinvoluntary divestiture\\u201d of a private\\nright. Newland v. Marsh, 19 Ill. 376, 382\\u2013383 (1857)\\n(emphasis added).\\n   But all of this does not necessarily mean that the major-\\nity has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.\\nEven if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-\\njudicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow\\nthat consent removes the Stern adjudication from the core\\nof the judicial power. There may be other aspects of the\\nadjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial\\npower, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable with-\\nout any further action by an Article III court. We have\\nrecognized that judgments entered by Article III courts\\nbear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the\\njudicial power, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S.\\n211, 218\\u2013219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a\\nfinal judgment bearing these qualities\\u2014irrespective of the\\nsubject matter of the dispute\\u2014is a quintessential judicial\\nfunction.

In particular, if we were to determine that\\ncurrent practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a\\nfeature that demands the exercise of the judicial power,\\nwould that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving\\nStern claims are void, or only that courts may not give\\neffect to that single feature that triggers Article III? The\\nparties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not re-\\nsolve them. But the number and magnitude of these\\nimportant questions\\u2014questions implicated by thousands\\nof bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year\\u2014\\nmerit closer attention than the majority has given them.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n  6 Numerous 19th-century State Supreme Courts held unconstitutional\\n\\nlaws authorizing individuals to consent to have their cases heard by an\\nindividual not qualified as a judge under provisions of State Consti-\\ntutions similar to Article III, \\u00a71. See, e.g., Winchester v. Ayres, 4 Iowa\\n104 (1853); Haverly Invincible Mining Co. v. Howcutt, 6 Colo. 574, 575\\u2013\\n576 (1883); Ex parte Alabama State Bar Assn., 92 Ala. 113, 8 So. 768\\n(1891); see also Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at 399. Acknowl-\\nedging the similarity between the practices under review and the\\nlegitimate practice of private arbitration, many of these decisions\\npremised their finding of unconstitutionality on the issuance of a\\njudgment or other writ that only judges may issue. See, e.g., Bishop v.\\nNelson, 83 Ill. 601 (1876) (per curiam) (\\u201cThis was not an arbitration . . .\\nbut it was an attempt to confer upon [Mr. Wood] the power of a judge,\\nto decide the pending case, and he did decide it, the court carrying out\\nhis decision by entering the judgment he had reached, and not [its] own\\njudgment\\u201d); Van Slyke v. Trempealeau Cty. Farmers\\u2019 Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,\\n39 Wis. 390, 393 (1876) (\\u201cWe cannot look into the bill of exceptions or\\nconsider the order denying a new trial, because both are unofficial and\\ndevoid of judicial authority\\u201d); see also id., at 395\\u2013396 (tracing this rule\\nback to English understandings of judicial power). These decisions\\ntreat the rule as a corollary to the rule that parties may not, by consent,\\nconfer jurisdiction. See, e.g., Higby v. Ayres, 14 Kan. 331, 334 (1875);\\nHoagland v. Creed, 81 Ill. 506, 507\\u2013508 (1876); see also Cooley, supra,\\nat 399.\\n                     Cite as: 575 U.

As instrumen-\\ntalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts\\nmust act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-\\nity. Even if the functions bankruptcy courts perform do not\\nrequire an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial\\npower, we would need to identify the source of Congress\\u2019\\nauthority to establish them and to authorize them to act.\\n   The historical carve-outs for territorial courts and\\ncourts-martial might provide some guidance. The Court\\nhas anchored Congress\\u2019 authority to create territorial\\ncourts in \\u201cthe general right of sovereignty which exists in\\nthe government, or in virtue of that clause which enables\\nCongress to make all needful rules and regulations, re-\\nspecting the territory belonging to the United States.\\u201d\\nCanter, 1 Pet., at 546. And it has anchored Congress\\u2019\\nauthority to create courts-martial in Congress\\u2019 Article I\\npowers concerning the Army and Navy, understood along-\\nside the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s exception of \\u201c \\u2018cases arising in\\nthe land or naval forces,\\u2019 \\u201d from the grand jury require-\\nment, and Article II\\u2019s requirement that the President\\nserve as commander in chief. Dynes, 20 How., at 78\\u201379.\\n   Although our cases examining the constitutionality of\\nstatutes allocating the power to the bankruptcy courts\\nhave not considered the source of Congress\\u2019 authority to\\nestablish them, the obvious textual basis is the fourth\\nclause of Article I, \\u00a78, which empowers Congress to \\u201cestab-\\nlish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\\nthroughout the United States.\\u201d7 But as with the other two\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n  7 In Northern Pipeline, the plurality rejected the argument that \\u201cCon-\\n\\ngress\\u2019 constitutional authority to establish \\u2018uniform Laws on the subject\\nof Bankruptcies throughout the United States\\u2019 carries with it an\\n18         WELLNESS INT\\u2019L NETWORK, LTD. v. SHARIF\\n\\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nhistorical carve-outs, Congress\\u2019 power to establish tribu-\\nnals within that grant is informed by historical under-\\nstandings of the bankruptcy power.8 We have suggested\\nthat, under this historical understanding, Congress has\\nthe power to establish bankruptcy courts that exercise\\njurisdiction akin to that of bankruptcy commissioners in\\nEngland, subject to review traditionally had in England.\\nAnte, at 3\\u20134 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Although Stern\\nclaims, by definition, lie outside those historical bounda-\\nries, a historical practice of allowing broader adjudication\\nby bankruptcy commissioners acting with the consent of\\nthe parties could alter the analysis. The parties once\\nagain do not brief these questions, but they merit closer\\nattention by this Court.\\n                        *     *    *\\n   Whether parties may consent to bankruptcy court adju-\\ndication of Stern claims is a difficult constitutional ques-\\ntion. It turns on issues that are not adequately considered\\nby the Court or briefed by the parties. And it cannot\\u2014and\\nshould not\\u2014be resolved through a cursory reading of\\nSchor, which itself is hardly a model of careful constitu-\\ntional interpretation. For these reasons, I would resolve\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\ninherent power to establish legislative courts capable of adjudicating\\n\\u2018bankruptcy-related controversies.\\u2019 \\u201d Northern Pipeline Constr.

On habeas review, we follow the established rule that the state's obligation under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, turns on the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government, and we hold that the prosecutor remains responsible for gauging that effect regardless of any failure by the police to bring favorable evidence to the prosecutor's attention. Because the net effect of the evidence withheld by the State in this case raises *422 a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have produced a different result, Kyles is entitled to a new trial.\\n\\nI\\nFollowing the mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict, Kyles's subsequent conviction and sentence of death were affirmed on direct appeal. State v. Kyles, 513 So. 2d 265 (La. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1027 (1988). On state collateral review, the trial court denied relief, but the Supreme Court of Louisiana remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Kyles's claims of newly discovered evidence. During this state-court proceeding, the defense was first able to present certain evidence, favorable to Kyles, that the State had failed to disclose before or during trial. The state trial court nevertheless denied relief, and the State Supreme Court denied Kyles's application for discretionary review. State ex rel. Kyles v. Butler, 566 So. 2d 386 (La. 1990).\\nKyles then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which denied the petition. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by a divided vote. 5 F.3d 806 (1993). As we explain, infra, at 440-441, there is reason to question whether the Court of Appeals evaluated the significance of undisclosed evidence under the correct standard. Because \\\"[o]ur duty to search for constitutional error with painstaking care is never more exacting than it is in a capital case,\\\" Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 785 (1987),[1] we granted certiorari, 511 U.S. 1051 (1994), and now reverse.\\n\\n\\n*423 II\\n\\nA\\nThe record indicates that, at about 2:20 p.m. on Thursday, September 20, 1984, 60-year-old Dolores Dye left the Schwegmann Brothers' store (Schwegmann's) on Old Gentilly Road in New Orleans after doing some food shopping. As she put her grocery bags into the trunk of her red Ford LTD, a man accosted her and after a short struggle drew a revolver, fired into her left temple, and killed her. The gunman took Dye's keys and drove away in the LTD.\\nNew Orleans police took statements from six eyewitnesses,[2] who offered various descriptions of the gunman. They agreed that he was a black man, and four of them said that he had braided hair. The witnesses differed significantly, however, in their descriptions of height, age, weight, build, and hair length. Two reported seeing a man of 17 or 18, while another described the gunman as looking as old as 28. One witness described him as 5'4\\\" or 5'5\\\", medium build, 140-150 pounds; another described the man as slim and close to six feet. One witness said he had a mustache; none of the others spoke of any facial hair at all. One witness said the murderer had shoulder-length hair; another described the hair as \\\"short.\\\"\\nSince the police believed the killer might have driven his own car to Schwegmann's and left it there when he drove off in Dye's LTD, they recorded the license numbers of the cars remaining in the parking lots around the store at 9:15 p.m. on the evening of the murder. Matching these numbers with registration records produced the names and addresses of the owners of the cars, with a notation of any owner's police *424 record. Despite this list and the eyewitness descriptions, the police had no lead to the gunman until the Saturday evening after the shooting.\\nAt 5:30 p.m., on September 22, a man identifying himself as James Joseph called the police and reported that on the day of the murder he had bought a red Thunderbird from a friend named Curtis, whom he later identified as petitioner, Curtis Kyles. He said that he had subsequently read about Dye's murder in the newspapers and feared that the car he purchased was the victim's. He agreed to meet with the police.\\nA few hours later, the informant met New Orleans Detective John Miller, who was wired with a hidden body microphone, through which the ensuing conversation was recorded. See App. 221-257 (transcript). The informant now said his name was Joseph Banks and that he was called Beanie. His actual name was Joseph Wallace.[3]\\nHis story, as well as his name, had changed since his earlier call. In place of his original account of buying a Thunderbird from Kyles on Thursday, Beanie told Miller that he had not seen Kyles at all on Thursday, id., at 249\\u0097 250, and had bought a red LTD the previous day, Friday, id.,  at 221-222, 225. Beanie led Miller to the parking lot of a nearby bar, where he had left the red LTD, later identified as Dye's.\\nBeanie told Miller that he lived with Kyles's brother-in-law (later identified as Johnny Burns),[4] whom Beanie repeatedly called his \\\"partner.\\\" Id., at 221. Beanie described Kyles as slim, about 6-feet tall, 24 or 25 years old, with a \\\"bush\\\" hairstyle. Id., at 226, 252. When asked if Kyles ever wore *425 his hair in plaits, Beanie said that he did but that he \\\"had a bush\\\" when Beanie bought the car. Id., at 249.\\nDuring the conversation, Beanie repeatedly expressed concern that he might himself be a suspect in the murder. He explained that he had been seen driving Dye's car on Friday evening in the French Quarter, admitted that he had changed its license plates, and worried that he \\\"could have been charged\\\" with the murder on the basis of his possession of the LTD. Id., at 231, 246, 250. He asked if he would be put in jail. Id., at 235, 246. Miller acknowledged that Beanie's possession of the car would have looked suspicious, id., at 247, but reassured him that he \\\"didn't do anything wrong,\\\" id., at 235.\\nBeanie seemed eager to cast suspicion on Kyles, who allegedly made his living by \\\"robbing people,\\\" and had tried to kill Beanie at some prior time. Id., at 228, 245, 251. Beanie said that Kyles regularly carried two pistols, a .38 and a .32, and that if the police could \\\"set him up good,\\\" they could \\\"get that same gun\\\" used to kill Dye. Id., at 228-229. Beanie rode with Miller and Miller's supervisor, Sgt. James Eaton, in an unmarked squad car to Desire Street, where he pointed out the building containing Kyles's apartment. Id.,  at 244-246.\\nBeanie told the officers that after he bought the car, he and his \\\"partner\\\" (Burns) drove Kyles to Schwegmann's about 9 p.m. on Friday evening to pick up Kyles's car, described as an orange four-door Ford.[5]Id., at 221, 223, 231-232, 242. When asked where Kyles's car had been parked, Beanie replied that it had been \\\"[o]n the same side [of the lot] where the woman was killed at.\\\" Id., at 231. The officers later drove Beanie to Schwegmann's, where he indicated the space where he claimed Kyles's car had been parked. Beanie went on to say that when he and Burns had brought Kyles to pick *426 up the car, Kyles had gone to some nearby bushes to retrieve a brown purse, id., at 253-255, which Kyles subsequently hid in a wardrobe at his apartment. Beanie said that Kyles had \\\"a lot of groceries\\\" in Schwegmann's bags and a new baby's potty \\\"in the car.\\\" Id., at 254-255. Beanie told Eaton that Kyles's garbage would go out the next day and that if Kyles was \\\"smart\\\" he would \\\"put [the purse] in [the] garbage.\\\" Id., at 257. Beanie made it clear that he expected some reward for his help, saying at one point that he was not \\\"doing all of this for nothing.\\\" Id., at 246. The police repeatedly assured Beanie that he would not lose the $400 he paid for the car. Id., at 243, 246.\\nAfter the visit to Schwegmann's, Eaton and Miller took Beanie to a police station where Miller interviewed him again on the record, which was transcribed and signed by Beanie, using his alias \\\"Joseph Banks.\\\" See id., at 214-220. This statement, Beanie's third (the telephone call being the first, then the recorded conversation), repeats some of the essentials of the second one: that Beanie had purchased a red Ford LTD from Kyles for $400 on Friday evening; that Kyles had his hair \\\"combed out\\\" at the time of the sale; and that Kyles carried a .32 and a .38 with him \\\"all the time.\\\"\\nPortions of the third statement, however, embellished or contradicted Beanie's preceding story and were even internally inconsistent. Beanie reported that after the sale, he and Kyles unloaded Schwegmann's grocery bags from the trunk and back seat of the LTD and placed them in Kyles's own car. Beanie said that Kyles took a brown purse from the front seat of the LTD and that they then drove in separate cars to Kyles's apartment, where they unloaded the groceries. Id., at 216-217. Beanie also claimed that, a few hours later, he and his \\\"partner\\\" Burns went with Kyles to Schwegmann's, where they recovered Kyles's car and a \\\"big brown pocket book\\\" from \\\"next to a building.\\\" Id., at 218. Beanie did not explain how Kyles could have picked up his car and recovered the purse at Schwegmann's, after Beanie *427 had seen Kyles with both just a few hours earlier. The police neither noted the inconsistencies nor questioned Beanie about them.\\nAlthough the police did not thereafter put Kyles under surveillance, Tr. 94 (Dec. 6, 1984), they learned about events at his apartment from Beanie, who went there twice on Sunday. According to a fourth statement by Beanie, this one given to the chief prosecutor in November (between the first and second trials), he first went to the apartment about 2 p.m., after a telephone conversation with a police officer who asked whether Kyles had the gun that was used to kill Dye. Beanie stayed in Kyles's apartment until about 5 p.m., when he left to call Detective John Miller. Then he returned about 7 p.m. and stayed until about 9:30 p.m., when he left to meet Miller, who also asked about the gun. According to this fourth statement, Beanie \\\"rode around\\\" with Miller until 3 a.m. on Monday, September 24. Sometime during those same early morning hours, detectives were sent at Sgt. Eaton's behest to pick up the rubbish outside Kyles's building. As Sgt. Eaton wrote in an inter office memorandum, he had \\\"reason to believe the victims [sic] personal papers and the Schwegmann's bags will be in the trash.\\\" Record, Defendant's Exh. 17.\\nAt 10:40 a.m., Kyles was arrested as he left the apartment, which was then searched under a warrant. Behind the kitchen stove, the police found a .32-caliber revolver containing five live rounds and one spent cartridge. Ballistics tests later showed that this pistol was used to murder Dye. In a wardrobe in a hallway leading to the kitchen, the officers found a homemade shoulder holster that fit the murder weapon. In a bedroom dresser drawer, they discovered two boxes of ammunition, one containing several .32-caliber rounds of the same brand as those found in the pistol. Back in the kitchen, various cans of cat and dog food, some of them of the brands Dye typically purchased, were found in Schwegmann's sacks. No other groceries were identified as *428 possibly being Dye's, and no potty was found. Later that afternoon at the police station, police opened the rubbish bags and found the victim's purse, identification, and other personal belongings wrapped in a Schwegmann's sack.\\nThe gun, the LTD, the purse, and the cans of pet food were dusted for fingerprints. The gun had been wiped clean. Several prints were found on the purse and on the LTD, but none was identified as Kyles's. Dye's prints were not found on any of the cans of pet food. Kyles's prints were found, however, on a small piece of paper taken from the front passenger-side floorboard of the LTD. The crime laboratory recorded the paper as a Schwegmann's sales slip, but without noting what had been printed on it, which was obliterated in the chemical process of lifting the fingerprints. A second Schwegmann's receipt was found in the trunk of the LTD, but Kyles's prints were not found on it. Beanie's fingerprints were not compared to any of the fingerprints found. Tr. 97 (Dec. 6, 1984).\\nThe lead detective on the case, John Dillman, put together a photo lineup that included a photograph of Kyles (but not of Beanie) and showed the array to five of the six eyewitnesses who had given statements. Three of them picked the photograph of Kyles; the other two could not confidently identify Kyles as Dye's assailant.\\n\\nB\\nKyles was indicted for first-degree murder. Before trial, his counsel filed a lengthy motion for disclosure by the State of any exculpatory or impeachment evidence. The prosecution responded that there was \\\"no exculpatory evidence of any nature,\\\" despite the government's knowledge of the following evidentiary items: (1) the six contemporaneous eyewitness statements taken by police following the murder; (2) records of Beanie's initial call to the police; (3) the tape recording of the Saturday conversation between Beanie and officers Eaton and Miller; (4) the typed and signed statement *429 given by Beanie on Sunday morning; (5) the computer printout of license numbers of cars parked at Schwegmann's on the night of the murder, which did not list the number of Kyles's car; (6) the internal police memorandum calling for the seizure of the rubbish after Beanie had suggested that the purse might be found there; and (7) evidence linking Beanie to other crimes at Schwegmann's and to the unrelated murder of one Patricia Leidenheimer, committed in January before the Dye murder.\\nAt the first trial, in November, the heart of the State's case was eyewitness testimony from four people who were at the scene of the crime (three of whom had previously picked Kyles from the photo lineup). Kyles maintained his innocence, offered supporting witnesses, and supplied an alibi that he had been picking up his children from school at the time of the murder. The theory of the defense was that Kyles had been framed by Beanie, who had planted evidence in Kyles's apartment and his rubbish for the purposes of shifting suspicion away from himself, removing an impediment to romance with Pinky Burns, and obtaining reward money. Beanie did not testify as a witness for either the defense or the prosecution.\\nBecause the State withheld evidence, its case was much stronger, and the defense case much weaker, than the full facts would have suggested. Even so, after four hours of deliberation, the jury became deadlocked on the issue of guilt, and a mistrial was declared.\\nAfter the mistrial, the chief trial prosecutor, Cliff Strider, interviewed Beanie. See App. 258-262 (notes of interview). Strider's notes show that Beanie again changed important elements of his story. He said that he went with Kyles to retrieve Kyles's car from the Schwegmann's lot on Thursday, the day of the murder, at some time between 5 and 7:30 p.m., not on Friday, at 9 p.m., as he had said in his second and third statements. (Indeed, in his second statement, Beanie said that he had not seen Kyles at all on Thursday. Id., at *430 249-250.) He also said, for the first time, that when they had picked up the car they were accompanied not only by Johnny Burns but also by Kevin Black, who had testified for the defense at the first trial. Beanie now claimed that after getting Kyles's car they went to Black's house, retrieved a number of bags of groceries, a child's potty, and a brown purse, all of which they took to Kyles's apartment. Beanie also stated that on the Sunday after the murder he had been at Kyles's apartment two separate times. Notwithstanding the many inconsistencies and variations among Beanie's statements, neither Strider's notes nor any of the other notes and transcripts were given to the defense.\\nIn December 1984, Kyles was tried a second time. Again, the heart of the State's case was the testimony of four eyewitnesses who positively identified Kyles in front of the jury. The prosecution also offered a blown-up photograph taken at the crime scene soon after the murder, on the basis of which the prosecutors argued that a seemingly two-toned car in the background of the photograph was Kyles's. They repeatedly suggested during cross-examination of defense witnesses that Kyles had left his own car at Schwegmann's on the day of the murder and had retrieved it later, a theory for which they offered no evidence beyond the blown-up photograph. Once again, Beanie did not testify.\\nAs in the first trial, the defense contended that the eyewitnesses were mistaken. Kyles's counsel called several individuals, including Kevin Black, who testified to seeing Beanie, with his hair in plaits, driving a red car similar to the victim's about an hour after the killing. Tr. 209 (Dec. 7, 1984). Another witness testified that Beanie, with his hair in braids, had tried to sell him the car on Thursday evening, shortly after the murder. Id., at 234-235. Another witness testified that Beanie, with his hair in a \\\"Jheri curl,\\\" had attempted to sell him the car on Friday. Id., at 249-251. One witness, Beanie's \\\"partner,\\\" Burns, testified that he had seen Beanie on Sunday at Kyles's apartment, stooping down near *431 the stove where the gun was eventually found, and the defense presented testimony that Beanie was romantically interested in Pinky Burns. To explain the pet food found in Kyles's apartment, there was testimony that Kyles's family kept a dog and cat and often fed stray animals in the neighborhood.\\nFinally, Kyles again took the stand. Denying any involvement in the shooting, he explained his fingerprints on the cash register receipt found in Dye's car by saying that Beanie had picked him up in a red car on Friday, September 21, and had taken him to Schwegmann's, where he purchased transmission fluid and a pack of cigarettes. He suggested that the receipt may have fallen from the bag when he removed the cigarettes.\\nOn rebuttal, the prosecutor had Beanie brought into the courtroom. All of the testifying eyewitnesses, after viewing Beanie standing next to Kyles, reaffirmed their previous identifications of Kyles as the murderer. Kyles was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Beanie received a total of $1,600 in reward money. See Tr. of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 19-20 (Feb. 24, 1989); id., at 114 (Feb. 20, 1989).\\nFollowing direct appeal, it was revealed in the course of state collateral review that the State had failed to disclose evidence favorable to the defense. After exhausting state remedies, Kyles sought relief on federal habeas, claiming, among other things, that the evidence withheld was material to his defense and that his conviction was thus obtained in violation of Brady. Although the United States District Court denied relief and the Fifth Circuit affirmed,[6] Judge *432 King dissented, writing that \\\"[f]or the first time in my fourteen years on this court . . . I have serious reservations about whether the State has sentenced to death the right man.\\\" 5 F.3d, at 820.\\n\\nIII\\nThe prosecution's affirmative duty to disclose evidence favorable to a defendant can trace its origins to early 20thcentury strictures against misrepresentation and is of course most prominently associated with this Court's decision in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). See id., at 86 (relying on Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935), and Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 215-216 (1942)). Brady held \\\"that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\\\" 373 U.S., at 87; see Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794-795 *433 (1972). In United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), however, it became clear that a defendant's failure to request favorable evidence did not leave the Government free of all obligation. There, the Court distinguished three situations in which a Brady claim might arise: first, where previously undisclosed evidence revealed that the prosecution introduced trial testimony that it knew or should have known was perjured, 427 U.S., at 103-104;[7] second, where the Government failed to accede to a defense request for disclosure of some specific kind of exculpatory evidence, id., at 104-107; and third, where the Government failed to volunteer exculpatory evidence never requested, or requested only in a general way. The Court found a duty on the part of the Government even in this last situation, though only when suppression of the evidence would be \\\"of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant's right to a fair trial.\\\" Id., at 108.\\nIn the third prominent case on the way to current Brady  law, United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), the Court disavowed any difference between exculpatory and impeachment evidence for Brady purposes, and it abandoned the distinction between the second and third Agurs circumstances, i. e., the \\\"specific-request\\\" and \\\"general- or no-request\\\" situations. Bagley held that regardless of request, favorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, \\\"if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\\\" *434 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 685 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\\nFour aspects of materiality under Bagley bear emphasis. Although the constitutional duty is triggered by the potential impact of favorable but undisclosed evidence, a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant's acquittal (whether based on the presence of reasonable doubt or acceptance of an explanation for the crime that does not inculpate the defendant). Id., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (adopting formulation announced in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984)); Bagley, supra, at 685 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (same); see 473 U.S., at 680 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (Agurs \\\"rejected a standard that would require the defendant to demonstrate that the evidence if disclosed probably would have resulted in acquittal\\\"); cf. Strickland, supra, at 693 (\\\"[W]e believe that a defendant need not show that counsel's deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case\\\"); Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 175 (1986) (\\\"[A] defendant need not establish that the attorney's deficient performance more likely than not altered the outcome in order to establish prejudice under Strickland \\\"). Bagley `s touchstone of materiality is a \\\"reasonable probability\\\" of a different result, and the adjective is important. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A \\\"reasonable probability\\\" of a different result is accordingly shown when the government's evidentiary suppression \\\"undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\\\" Bagley, 473 U. S., at 678.\\nThe second aspect of Bagley materiality bearing emphasis here is that it is not a sufficiency of evidence test. A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory *435 evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. The possibility of an acquittal on a criminal charge does not imply an insufficient evidentiary basis to convict. One does not show a Brady violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.[8]\\nThird, we note that, contrary to the assumption made by the Court of Appeals, 5 F.3d, at 818, once a reviewing court applying Bagley has found constitutional error there is no need for further harmless-error review. Assuming, arguendo, that a harmless-error enquiry were to apply, a Bagley  error could not be treated as harmless, since \\\"a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\\\" 473 U.S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 685 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), necessarily entails the conclusion that the suppression must have had \\\"`substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,' \\\" Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 623 (1993), quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946). This is amply confirmed by the development of the respective governing standards. Although *436 Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967), held that a conviction tainted by constitutional error must be set aside unless the error complained of \\\"was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\\\" we held in Brecht that the standard of harmlessness generally to be applied in habeas cases is the Kotteakos formulation (previously applicable only in reviewing nonconstitutional errors on direct appeal), Brecht, supra, at 622-623. Under Kotteakos a conviction may be set aside only if the error \\\"had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\\\" Kotteakos, supra, at 776. Agurs, however, had previously rejected Kotteakos as the standard governing constitutional disclosure claims, reasoning that \\\"the constitutional standard of materiality must impose a higher burden on the defendant.\\\" Agurs, 427 U. S., at 112. Agurs thus opted for its formulation of materiality, later adopted as the test for prejudice in Strickland, only after expressly noting that this standard would recognize reversible constitutional error only when the harm to the defendant was greater than the harm sufficient for reversal under Kotteakos. In sum, once there has been Bagley error as claimed in this case, it cannot subsequently be found harmless under Brecht.[9]\\nThe fourth and final aspect of Bagley materiality to be stressed here is its definition in terms of suppressed evidence considered collectively, not item by item.[10] As Justice Blackmun emphasized in the portion of his opinion written for the Court, the Constitution is not violated every time the *437 government fails or chooses not to disclose evidence that might prove helpful to the defense. 473 U.S., at 675, and n. 7. We have never held that the Constitution demands an open file policy (however such a policy might work out in practice), and the rule in Bagley (and, hence, in Brady ) requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures of any evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-3.11(a) (3d ed. 1993) (\\\"A prosecutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure to the defense, at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the existence of all evidence or information which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged or which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused\\\"); ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (\\\"The prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense\\\").\\nWhile the definition of Bagley materiality in terms of the cumulative effect of suppression must accordingly be seen as leaving the government with a degree of discretion, it must also be understood as imposing a corresponding burden. On the one side, showing that the prosecution knew of an item of favorable evidence unknown to the defense does not amount to a Brady violation, without more. But the prosecution, which alone can know what is undisclosed, must be assigned the consequent responsibility to gauge the likely net effect of all such evidence and make disclosure when the point of \\\"reasonable probability\\\" is reached. This in turn means that the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police. But whether the prosecutor succeeds or fails in meeting this obligation (whether, that is, a failure to disclose is in good faith *438 or bad faith, see Brady, 373 U. S., at 87), the prosecution's responsibility for failing to disclose known, favorable evidence rising to a material level of importance is inescapable.\\nThe State of Louisiana would prefer an even more lenient rule. It pleads that some of the favorable evidence in issue here was not disclosed even to the prosecutor until after trial, Brief for Respondent 25, 27, 30, 31, and it suggested below that it should not be held accountable under Bagley  and Brady for evidence known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.[11] To accommodate the State in this manner would, however, amount to a serious change of course from the Brady line of cases. In the State's favor it may be said that no one doubts that police investigators sometimes fail to inform a prosecutor of all they know. But neither is there any serious doubt that \\\"procedures and regulations can be established to carry [the prosecutor's] burden and to insure communication of all relevant information on each case to every lawyer who deals with it.\\\" Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972). Since, then, the prosecutor has the means to discharge the government's Brady responsibility if he will, any argument for excusing a prosecutor from disclosing what he does not happen to know about boils down to a plea to substitute the police for the prosecutor, and even for the courts themselves, as the final arbiters of the government's obligation to ensure fair trials.\\nShort of doing that, we were asked at oral argument to raise the threshold of materiality because the Bagley standard \\\"makes it difficult . . . to know\\\" from the \\\"perspective [of the prosecutor at] trial . . . exactly what might become important later on.\\\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. The State asks for \\\"a certain amount of leeway in making a judgment call\\\" as to the disclosure of any given piece of evidence. Ibid. \\n*439 Uncertainty about the degree of further \\\"leeway\\\" that might satisfy the State's request for a \\\"certain amount\\\" of it is the least of the reasons to deny the request. At bottom, what the State fails to recognize is that, with or without more leeway, the prosecution cannot be subject to any disclosure obligation without at some point having the responsibility to determine when it must act. Indeed, even if due process were thought to be violated by every failure to disclose an item of exculpatory or impeachment evidence (leaving harmless error as the government's only fallback), the prosecutor would still be forced to make judgment calls about what would count as favorable evidence, owing to the very fact that the character of a piece of evidence as favorable will often turn on the context of the existing or potential evidentiary record. Since the prosecutor would have to exercise some judgment even if the State were subject to this most stringent disclosure obligation, it is hard to find merit in the State's complaint over the responsibility for judgment under the existing system, which does not tax the prosecutor with error for any failure to disclose, absent a further showing of materiality. Unless, indeed, the adversary system of prosecution is to descend to a gladiatorial level unmitigated by any prosecutorial obligation for the sake of truth, the government simply cannot avoid responsibility for knowing when the suppression of evidence has come to portend such an effect on a trial's outcome as to destroy confidence in its result.\\nThis means, naturally, that a prosecutor anxious about tacking too close to the wind will disclose a favorable piece of evidence. See Agurs, 427 U. S., at 108 (\\\"[T]he prudent prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of disclosure\\\"). This is as it should be. Such disclosure will serve to justify trust in the prosecutor as \\\"the representative . . . of a sovereignty . . . whose interest . . . in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\\\" Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). *440 And it will tend to preserve the criminal trial, as distinct from the prosecutor's private deliberations, as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations. See Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-578 (1986); Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 540 (1965); United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 900-901 (1984) (recognizing general goal of establishing \\\"procedures under which criminal defendants are `acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth' \\\" (quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 175 (1969)). The prudence of the careful prosecutor should not therefore be discouraged.\\nThere is room to debate whether the two judges in the majority in the Court of Appeals made an assessment of the cumulative effect of the evidence. Although the majority's Brady discussion concludes with the statement that the court was not persuaded of the reasonable probability that Kyles would have obtained a favorable verdict if the jury had been \\\"exposed to any or all of the undisclosed materials,\\\" 5 F.3d, at 817, the opinion also contains repeated references dismissing particular items of evidence as immaterial and so suggesting that cumulative materiality was not the touchstone. See, e. g., id., at 812 (\\\"We do not agree that this statement made the transcript material and so mandated disclosure . . . . Beanie's statement . . . is itself not decisive\\\"), 814 (\\\"The nondisclosure of this much of the transcript was insignificant\\\"), 815 (\\\"Kyles has not shown on this basis that the three statements were material\\\"), 815 (\\\"In light of the entire record . . . we cannot conclude that [police reports relating to discovery of the purse in the trash] would, in reasonable probability, have moved the jury to embrace the theory it otherwise discounted\\\"), 816 (\\\"We are not persuaded that these notes [relating to discovery of the gun] were material\\\"), 816 (\\\"[W]e are not persuaded that [the printout of the license plate numbers] would, in reasonable probability, have induced reasonable doubt where the jury did not find it. . . . the rebuttal of the photograph would have made no difference\\\"). *441 The result reached by the Fifth Circuit majority is compatible with a series of independent materiality evaluations, rather than the cumulative evaluation required by Bagley, as the ensuing discussion will show.\\n\\nIV\\nIn this case, disclosure of the suppressed evidence to competent counsel would have made a different result reasonably probable.\\n\\nA\\nAs the District Court put it, \\\"the essence of the State's case\\\" was the testimony of eyewitnesses, who identified Kyles as Dye's killer. 5 F.3d, at 853 (Appendix A). Disclosure of their statements would have resulted in a markedly weaker case for the prosecution and a markedly stronger one for the defense. To begin with, the value of two of those witnesses would have been substantially reduced or destroyed.\\nThe State rated Henry Williams as its best witness, who testified that he had seen the struggle and the actual shooting by Kyles. The jury would have found it helpful to probe this conclusion in the light of Williams's contemporaneous statement, in which he told the police that the assailant was \\\"a black male, about 19 or 20 years old, about 5'4\\\" or 5'5\\\", 140 to 150 pounds, medium build\\\" and that \\\"his hair looked like it was platted.\\\" App. 197. If cross-examined on this description, Williams would have had trouble explaining how he could have described Kyles, 6-feet tall and thin, as a man more than half a foot shorter with a medium build.[12] Indeed, since Beanie was 22 years old, 5'5\\\" tall, and 159 pounds, *442 the defense would have had a compelling argument that Williams's description pointed to Beanie but not to Kyles.[13]\\nThe trial testimony of a second eyewitness, Isaac Smallwood, was equally damning to Kyles. He testified that Kyles was the assailant, and that he saw him struggle with Dye. He said he saw Kyles take a \\\".32, a small black gun\\\" out of his right pocket, shoot Dye in the head, and drive off in her LTD. When the prosecutor asked him whether he actually saw Kyles shoot Dye, Smallwood answered \\\"Yeah.\\\" Tr. 41-48 (Dec. 6, 1984).\\nSmallwood's statement taken at the parking lot, however, was vastly different. Immediately after the crime, Smallwood *443 claimed that he had not seen the actual murder and had not seen the assailant outside the vehicle. \\\"I heard a lound [sic]pop,\\\" he said. \\\"When I looked around I saw a lady laying on the ground, and there was a red car coming toward me.\\\" App. 189. Smallwood said that he got a look at the culprit, a black teenage male with a mustache and shoulder-length braided hair, as the victim's red Thunderbird passed where he was standing. When a police investigator specifically asked him whether he had seen the assailant outside the car, Smallwood answered that he had not; the gunman \\\"was already in the car and coming toward me.\\\" Id., at 188-190.\\nA jury would reasonably have been troubled by the adjustments to Smallwood's original story by the time of the second trial. The struggle and shooting, which earlier he had not seen, he was able to describe with such detailed clarity as to identify the murder weapon as a small black .32-caliber pistol, which, of course, was the type of weapon used. His description of the victim's car had gone from a \\\"Thunderbird\\\" to an \\\"LTD\\\"; and he saw fit to say nothing about the assailant's shoulder-length hair and moustache, details noted by no other eyewitness. These developments would have fueled a withering cross-examination, destroying confidence in Smallwood's story and raising a substantial implication that the prosecutor had coached him to give it.[14]\\n*444 Since the evolution over time of a given eyewitness's description can be fatal to its reliability, cf. Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977) (reliability depends in part on the accuracy of prior description); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199 (1972) (reliability of identification following impermissibly suggestive lineup depends in part on accuracy of witness's prior description), the Smallwood and Williams identifications would have been severely undermined by use of their suppressed statements. The likely damage is best understood by taking the word of the prosecutor, who contended during closing arguments that Smallwood and Williams were the State's two best witnesses. See Tr. of Closing Arg. 49 (Dec. 7, 1984) (After discussing Territo's and Kersh's testimony: \\\"Isaac Smallwood, have you ever seen a better witness[?] . . . What's better than that is Henry Williams. . . . Henry Williams was the closest of them all *445 right here\\\"). Nor, of course, would the harm to the State's case on identity have been confined to their testimony alone. The fact that neither Williams nor Smallwood could have provided a consistent eyewitness description pointing to Kyles would have undercut the prosecution all the more because the remaining eyewitnesses called to testify (Territo and Kersh) had their best views of the gunman only as he fled the scene with his body partly concealed in Dye's car. And even aside from such important details, the effective impeachment of one eyewitness can call for a new trial even though the attack does not extend directly to others, as we have said before. See Agurs, 427 U. S., at 112-113, n. 21.\\n\\nB\\nDamage to the prosecution's case would not have been confined to evidence of the eyewitnesses, for Beanie's various statements would have raised opportunities to attack not only the probative value of crucial physical evidence and the circumstances in which it was found, but the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation, as well. By the State's own admission, Beanie was essential to its investigation and, indeed, \\\"made the case\\\" against Kyles. Tr. of Closing Arg. 13 (Dec. 7, 1984). Contrary to what one might hope for from such a source, however, Beanie's statements to the police were replete with inconsistencies and would have allowed the jury to infer that Beanie was anxious to see Kyles arrested for Dye's murder. Their disclosure would have revealed a remarkably uncritical attitude on the part of the police.\\nIf the defense had called Beanie as an adverse witness, he could not have said anything of any significance without being trapped by his inconsistencies. A short recapitulation of some of them will make the point. In Beanie's initial meeting with the police, and in his signed statement, he said he bought Dye's LTD and helped Kyles retrieve his car from the Schwegmann's lot on Friday. In his first call to the police, *446 he said he bought the LTD on Thursday, and in his conversation with the prosecutor between trials it was again on Thursday that he said he helped Kyles retrieve Kyles's car. Although none of the first three versions of this story mentioned Kevin Black as taking part in the retrieval of the car and transfer of groceries, after Black implicated Beanie by his testimony for the defense at the first trial, Beanie changed his story to include Black as a participant. In Beanie's several accounts, Dye's purse first shows up variously next to a building, in some bushes, in Kyles's car, and at Black's house.\\nEven if Kyles's lawyer had followed the more conservative course of leaving Beanie off the stand, though, the defense could have examined the police to good effect on their knowledge of Beanie's statements and so have attacked the reliability of the investigation in failing even to consider Beanie's possible guilt and in tolerating (if not countenancing) serious possibilities that incriminating evidence had been planted. See, e. g., Bowen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 613 (CA10 1986) (\\\"A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant, and we may consider such use in assessing a possible Brady violation\\\"); Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d 1034, 1042 (CA5 1985) (awarding new trial of prisoner convicted in Louisiana state court because withheld Brady evidence \\\"carried within it the potential . . . for the . . . discrediting . . . of the police methods employed in assembling the case\\\").[15]\\n*447 By demonstrating the detectives' knowledge of Beanie's affirmatively self-incriminating statements, the defense could have laid the foundation for a vigorous argument that the police had been guilty of negligence. In his initial meeting with police, Beanie admitted twice that he changed the license plates on the LTD. This admission enhanced the suspiciousness of his possession of the car; the defense could have argued persuasively that he was no bona fide purchaser. And when combined with his police record, evidence of prior criminal activity near Schwegmann's, and his status as a suspect in another murder, his devious behavior gave reason to believe that he had done more than buy a stolen car. There was further self-incrimination in Beanie's statement that Kyles's car was parked in the same part of the Schwegmann's lot where Dye was killed. Beanie's apparent awareness of the specific location of the murder could have been based, as the State contends, on television or newspaper reports, but perhaps it was not. Cf. App. 215 (Beanie saying that he knew about the murder because his brother-in-law had seen it \\\"on T. V. and in the paper\\\" and had told Beanie). Since the police admittedly never treated Beanie as a suspect, the defense could thus have used his statements to throw the reliability of the investigation into doubt and to sully the credibility of Detective Dillman, who testified that Beanie was never a suspect, Tr. 103-105, 107 (Dec. 6, 1984), and that he had \\\"no knowledge\\\" that Beanie had changed the license plate, id., at 95.\\nThe admitted failure of the police to pursue these pointers toward Beanie's possible guilt could only have magnified the effect on the jury of explaining how the purse and the gun happened to be recovered. In Beanie's original recorded statement, he told the police that \\\"[Kyles's] garbage goes out tomorrow,\\\" and that \\\"if he's smart he'll put [the purse] in [the] garbage.\\\" App. 257. These statements, along with the internal memorandum stating that the police had \\\"reason to believe\\\" Dye's personal effects and Schwegmann's bags *448 would be in the garbage, would have supported the defense's theory that Beanie was no mere observer, but was determining the investigation's direction and success. The potential for damage from using Beanie's statement to undermine the ostensible integrity of the investigation is only confirmed by the prosecutor's admission at one of Kyles's post conviction hearings, that he did not recall a single instance before this case when police had searched and seized garbage on the street in front of a residence, Tr. of Hearing on PostConviction Relief 113 (Feb. 20, 1989), and by Detective John Miller's admission at the same hearing that he thought at the time that it \\\"was a possibility\\\" that Beanie had planted the incriminating evidence in the garbage, Tr. of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 51 (Feb. 24, 1989). If a police officer thought so, a juror would have, too.[16]\\nTo the same effect would have been an enquiry based on Beanie's apparently revealing remark to police that \\\"if you can set [Kyles] up good, you can get that same gun.\\\"[17] App. 228-229. While the jury might have understood that Beanie meant simply that if the police investigated Kyles, they would probably find the murder weapon, the jury could also have taken Beanie to have been making the more sinister *449 suggestion that the police \\\"set up\\\" Kyles, and the defense could have argued that the police accepted the invitation. The prosecutor's notes of his interview with Beanie would have shown that police officers were asking Beanie the whereabouts of the gun all day Sunday, the very day when he was twice at Kyles's apartment and was allegedly seen by Johnny Burns lurking near the stove, where the gun was later found.[18] Beanie's same statement, indeed, could have been used to cap an attack on the integrity of the investigation and on the reliability of Detective Dillman, who testified on cross-examination that he did not know if Beanie had been at Kyles's apartment on Sunday. Tr. 93, 101 (Dec. 6, 1984).[19]\\n\\n\\n*450 C\\nNext to be considered is the prosecution's list of the cars in the Schwegmann's parking lot at mid-evening after the murder. While its suppression does not rank with the failure to disclose the other evidence discussed here, it would have had some value as exculpation and impeachment, and it counts accordingly in determining whether Bagley `s standard of materiality is satisfied. On the police's assumption, argued to the jury, that the killer drove to the lot and left his car there during the heat of the investigation, the list without Kyles's registration would obviously have helped Kyles and would have had some value in countering an argument by the prosecution that a grainy enlargement of a photograph of the crime scene showed Kyles's car in the background. The list would also have shown that the police either knew that it was inconsistent with their informant's second and third statements (in which Beanie described retrieving Kyles's car after the time the list was compiled) or never even bothered to check the informant's story against known fact. Either way, the defense would have had further support for arguing that the police were irresponsible in relying on Beanie to tip them off to the location of evidence damaging to Kyles.\\nThe State argues that the list was neither impeachment nor exculpatory evidence because Kyles could have moved his car before the list was created and because the list does *451 not purport to be a comprehensive listing of all the cars in the Schwegmann's lot. Such argument, however, confuses the weight of the evidence with its favorable tendency, and even if accepted would work against the State, not for it. If the police had testified that the list was incomplete, they would simply have underscored the unreliability of the investigation and complemented the defense's attack on the failure to treat Beanie as a suspect and his statements with a presumption of fallibility. But however the evidence would have been used, it would have had some weight and its tendency would have been favorable to Kyles.\\n\\nD\\nIn assessing the significance of the evidence withheld, one must of course bear in mind that not every item of the State's case would have been directly undercut if the Brady evidence had been disclosed. It is significant, however, that the physical evidence remaining unscathed would, by the State's own admission, hardly have amounted to overwhelming proof that Kyles was the murderer. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56 (\\\"The heart of the State's case was eye-witness identification\\\"); see also Tr. of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 117 (Feb. 20, 1989) (testimony of chief prosecutor Strider) (\\\"The crux of the case was the four eye-witnesses\\\"). Ammunition and a holster were found in Kyles's apartment, but if the jury had suspected the gun had been planted the significance of these items might have been left in doubt. The fact that pet food was found in Kyles's apartment was consistent with the testimony of several defense witnesses that Kyles owned a dog and that his children fed stray cats. The brands of pet food found were only two of the brands that Dye typically bought, and these two were common, whereas the one specialty brand that was found in Dye's apartment after her murder, Tr. 180 (Dec. 7, 1984), was not found in Kyles's apartment, id., at 188. Although Kyles was wrong in describing the cat food as being on sale the day he said he bought it, he *452 was right in describing the way it was priced at Schwegmann's market, where he commonly shopped.[20]\\nSimilarly undispositive is the small Schwegmann's receipt on the front passenger floorboard of the LTD, the only physical evidence that bore a fingerprint identified as Kyles's. Kyles explained that Beanie had driven him to Schwegmann's on Friday to buy cigarettes and transmission fluid, and he theorized that the slip must have fallen out of the bag when he removed the cigarettes. This explanation is consistent with the location of the slip when found and with its small size. The State cannot very well argue that the fingerprint ties Kyles to the killing without also explaining how the 2-inch-long register slip could have been the receipt for a week's worth of groceries, which Dye had gone to Schwegmann's to purchase. Id., at 181-182.[21]\\n*453 The inconclusiveness of the physical evidence does not, to be sure, prove Kyles's innocence, and the jury might have found the eyewitness testimony of Territo and Kersh sufficient to convict, even though less damning to Kyles than that of Smallwood and Williams.[22] But the question is not whether the State would have had a case to go to the jury if it had disclosed the favorable evidence, but whether we can be confident that the jury's verdict would have been the same. Confidence that it would have been cannot survive a recap of the suppressed evidence and its significance for the prosecution. The jury would have been entitled to find\\n(a) that the investigation was limited by the police's uncritical readiness to accept the story and suggestions of an informant whose accounts were inconsistent to the point, for example, of including four different versions of the discovery of the victim's purse, and whose own behavior was enough to raise suspicions of guilt;\\n(b) that the lead police detective who testified was either less than wholly candid or less than fully informed;\\n(c) that the informant's behavior raised suspicions that he had planted both the murder weapon and the victim's purse in the places they were found;\\n(d) that one of the four eyewitnesses crucial to the State's case had given a description that did not match the defendant and better described the informant;\\n(e) that another eyewitness had been coached, since he had first stated that he had not seen the killer outside the getaway car, or the killing itself, whereas at trial he *454 claimed to have seen the shooting, described the murder weapon exactly, and omitted portions of his initial description that would have been troublesome for the case;\\n(f) that there was no consistency to eyewitness descriptions of the killer's height, build, age, facial hair, or hair length.\\nSince all of these possible findings were precluded by the prosecution's failure to disclose the evidence that would have supported them, \\\"fairness\\\" cannot be stretched to the point of calling this a fair trial. Perhaps, confidence that the verdict would have been the same could survive the evidence impeaching even two eyewitnesses if the discoveries of gun and purse were above suspicion. Perhaps those suspicious circumstances would not defeat confidence in the verdict if the eyewitnesses had generally agreed on a description and were free of impeachment. But confidence that the verdict would have been unaffected cannot survive when suppressed evidence would have entitled a jury to find that the eyewitnesses were not consistent in describing the killer, that two out of the four eyewitnesses testifying were unreliable, that the most damning physical evidence was subject to suspicion, that the investigation that produced it was insufficiently probing, and that the principal police witness was insufficiently informed or candid. This is not the \\\"massive\\\" case envisioned by the dissent, post, at 475; it is a significantly weaker case than the one heard by the first jury, which could not even reach a verdict.\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\",\n          \"The Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA or Act), 18 U.S. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2721-2725 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV), regulates the disclosure of personal information contained in the records of state motor vehicle departments (DMVs). We hold that in enacting this statute Congress did not run afoul of the federalism principles enunciated in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), and Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).\\nThe DPPA regulates the disclosure and resale of personal information contained in the records of state DMVs. State DMVs require drivers and automobile owners to provide personal information, which may include a person's name, address, telephone number, vehicle description, Social Security number, medical information, and photograph, as a condition of obtaining a driver's license or registering an automobile. Congress found that many States, in turn, sell this personal information to individuals and businesses. See, e. g., 139 Cong. Rec. 29466, 29468, 29469 (1993); 140 Cong. Rec. 7929 *144 (1994) (remarks of Rep. Goss). These sales generate significant revenues for the States. See Travis v. Reno, 163 F.3d 1000, 1002 (CA7 1998) (noting that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation receives approximately $8 million each year from the sale of motor vehicle information).\\nThe DPPA establishes a regulatory scheme that restricts the States' ability to disclose a driver's personal information without the driver's consent. The DPPA generally prohibits any state DMV, or officer, employee, or contractor thereof, from \\\"knowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to any person or entity personal information about any individual obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record.\\\" 18 U.S. C. \\u00a7 2721(a). The DPPA defines \\\"personal information\\\" as any information \\\"that identifies an individual, including an individual's photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address (but not the 5-digit zip code), telephone number, and medical or disability information,\\\" but not including \\\"information on vehicular accidents, driving violations, and driver's status.\\\" \\u00a7 2725(3). A \\\"motor vehicle record\\\" is defined as \\\"any record that pertains to a motor vehicle operator's permit, motor vehicle title, motor vehicle registration, or identification card issued by a department of motor vehicles.\\\" \\u00a7 2725(1).\\nThe DPPA's ban on disclosure of personal information does not apply if drivers have consented to the release of their data. When we granted certiorari in this case, the DPPA provided that a DMV could obtain that consent either on a case-by-case basis or could imply consent if the State provided drivers with an opportunity to block disclosure of their personal information when they received or renewed their licenses and drivers did not avail themselves of that opportunity. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2721(b)(11), (13), and (d). However, Public Law 106-69, 113 Stat. 986, which was signed into law on October 9, 1999, changed this \\\"opt-out\\\" alternative to an \\\"opt-in\\\" requirement. Under the amended DPPA, States may not imply consent from a driver's failure to take advantage of a *145 state-afforded opportunity to block disclosure, but must rather obtain a driver's affirmative consent to disclose the driver's personal information for use in surveys, marketing, solicitations, and other restricted purposes. See Pub. L. 106-69, 113 Stat. 986 \\u00a7\\u00a7 350(c), (d), and (e), App. to Supp. Brief for Petitioners 1(a), 2(a).\\nThe DPPA's prohibition of nonconsensual disclosures is also subject to a number of statutory exceptions. For example, the DPPA requires disclosure of personal information \\\"for use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft, motor vehicle emissions, motor vehicle product alterations, recalls, or advisories, performance monitoring of motor vehicles and dealers by motor vehicle manufacturers, and removal of non-owner records from the original owner records of motor vehicle manufacturers to carry out the purposes of titles I and IV of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, the Automobile Information Disclosure Act, the Clean Air Act, and chapters 301, 305, and 321-331 of title 49.\\\" 18 U.S. C. \\u00a7 2721(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (citations omitted). The DPPA permits DMVs to disclose personal information from motor vehicle records for a number of purposes.[1]\\n*146 The DPPA's provisions do not apply solely to States. The Act also regulates the resale and redisclosure of drivers' personal information by private persons who have obtained that information from a state DMV. 18 U.S. C. \\u00a7 2721(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. III). In general, the Act allows private persons who have obtained drivers' personal information for one of the aforementioned permissible purposes to further disclose that information for any one of those purposes. Ibid.  If a State has obtained drivers' consent to disclose their personal information to private persons generally and a private person has obtained that information, the private person may redisclose the information for any purpose. Ibid. Additionally, a private actor who has obtained drivers' information from DMV records specifically for direct-marketing purposes may resell that information for other direct-marketing uses, but not otherwise. Ibid. Any person who rediscloses or resells personal information from DMV records must, for five years, maintain records identifying to whom the records were disclosed and the permitted purpose for the resale or redisclosure. Ibid. \\nThe DPPA establishes several penalties to be imposed on States and private actors that fail to comply with its requirements. The Act makes it unlawful for any \\\"person\\\" knowingly to obtain or disclose any record for a use that is not permitted under its provisions, or to make a false representation in order to obtain personal information from a motor vehicle record. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2722(a) and (b). Any person who knowingly violates the DPPA may be subject to a criminal fine, \\u00a7\\u00a7 2723(a), 2725(2). Additionally, any person who knowingly obtains, discloses, or uses information from a state motor vehicle record for a use other than those specifically permitted by the DPPA may be subject to liability in a civil action *147 brought by the driver to whom the information pertains. \\u00a7 2724. While the DPPA defines \\\"person\\\" to exclude States and state agencies, \\u00a7 2725(2), a state agency that maintains a \\\"policy or practice of substantial noncompliance\\\" with the Act may be subject to a civil penalty imposed by the United States Attorney General of not more than $5,000 per day of substantial noncompliance. \\u00a7 2723(b).\\nSouth Carolina law conflicts with the DPPA's provisions. Under that law, the information contained in the State's DMV records is available to any person or entity that fills out a form listing the requester's name and address and stating that the information will not be used for telephone solicitation. S. C. Code Ann. \\u00a7\\u00a7 56-3\\u0097510 to 56-3\\u0097540 (Supp. 1998). South Carolina's DMV retains a copy of all requests for information from the State's motor vehicle records, and it is required to release copies of all requests relating to a person upon that person's written petition. \\u00a7 56-3\\u0097520. State law authorizes the South Carolina DMV to charge a fee for releasing motor vehicle information, and it requires the DMV to allow drivers to prohibit the use of their motor vehicle information for certain commercial activities. \\u00a7\\u00a7 56\\u0097 3-530, 56-3\\u0097540.\\nFollowing the DPPA's enactment, South Carolina and its Attorney General, respondent Condon, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleging that the DPPA violates the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the United States Constitution. The District Court concluded that the Act is incompatible with the principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution's division of power between the States and the Federal Government. The court accordingly granted summary judgment for the State and permanently enjoined the Act's enforcement against the State and its officers. See 972 F. Supp. 977, 979 (1997). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Act violates constitutional principles *148 of federalism. See 155 F.3d 453 (1998). We granted certiorari, 526 U.S. 1111 (1999), and now reverse.\\nWe of course begin with the time-honored presumption that the DPPA is a \\\"constitutional exercise of legislative power.\\\" Close v. Glenwood Cemetery, 107 U.S. 466, 475 (1883); see also INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944 (1983).\\nThe United States asserts that the DPPA is a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \\u00a7 8, cl. 3.[2] The United States bases its Commerce Clause argument on the fact that the personal, identifying information that the DPPA regulates is a \\\"thin[g] in interstate commerce,\\\" and that the sale or release of that information in interstate commerce is therefore a proper subject of congressional regulation. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-559 (1995). We agree with the United States' contention. The motor vehicle information which the States have historically sold is used by insurers, manufacturers, direct marketers, and others engaged in interstate commerce to contact drivers with customized solicitations. The information is also used in the stream of interstate commerce by various public and private entities for matters related to interstate motoring. Because drivers' information is, in this context, an article of commerce, its sale or release into the interstate stream of business is sufficient to support congressional regulation. We therefore need not address the Government's alternative argument that the States' individual, intrastate activities in gathering, maintaining, and distributing drivers' personal *149 information have a sufficiently substantial impact on interstate commerce to create a constitutional base for federal legislation.\\nBut the fact that drivers' personal information is, in the context of this case, an article in interstate commerce does not conclusively resolve the constitutionality of the DPPA. In New York and Printz, we held federal statutes invalid, not because Congress lacked legislative authority over the subject matter, but because those statutes violated the principles of federalism contained in the Tenth Amendment. In New York, Congress commandeered the state legislative process by requiring a state legislature to enact a particular kind of law. We said:\\n\\\"While Congress has substantial powers to govern the Nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the States, the Constitution has never been understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern according to Congress' instructions. See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559, 565 (1911).\\\" 505 U.S., at 162.\\nIn Printz, we invalidated a provision of the Brady Act which commanded \\\"state and local enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers.\\\" 521 U.S., at 902. We said:\\n\\\"We held in New York that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States' officers directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.\\\" Id., at 935.\\nSouth Carolina contends that the DPPA violates the Tenth Amendment because it \\\"thrusts upon the States all of the *150 day-to-day responsibility for administering its complex provisions,\\\" Brief for Respondents 10, and thereby makes \\\"state officials the unwilling implementors of federal policy,\\\" id., at 11.[3] South Carolina emphasizes that the DPPA requires the State's employees to learn and apply the Act's substantive restrictions, which are summarized above, and notes that these activities will consume the employees' time and thus the State's resources. South Carolina further notes that the DPPA's penalty provisions hang over the States as a potential punishment should they fail to comply with the Act.\\nWe agree with South Carolina's assertion that the DPPA's provisions will require time and effort on the part of state employees, but reject the State's argument that the DPPA violates the principles laid down in either New York or Printz. We think, instead, that this case is governed by our decision in South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505 (1988). In Baker, we upheld a statute that prohibited States from issuing unregistered bonds because the law \\\"regulate[d] state activities,\\\" rather than \\\"seek[ing] to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.\\\" Id., at 514-515. We further noted:\\n\\\"The [National Governor's Association] nonetheless contends that \\u00a7 310 has commandeered the state legislative and administrative process because many state legislatures had to amend a substantial number of statutes in order to issue bonds in registered form and because state officials had to devote substantial effort to determine how best to implement a registered bond system. Such `commandeering' is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity. Any federal regulation demands compliance. That a State wishing to engage *151 in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.\\\" Ibid. \\nLike the statute at issue in Baker, the DPPA does not require the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens. The DPPA regulates the States as the owners of data bases. It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it does not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals. We accordingly conclude that the DPPA is consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in New York and Printz. \\nAs a final matter, we turn to South Carolina's argument that the DPPA is unconstitutional because it regulates the States exclusively. The essence of South Carolina's argument is that Congress may only regulate the States by means of \\\"generally applicable\\\" laws, or laws that apply to individuals as well as States. But we need not address the question whether general applicability is a constitutional requirement for federal regulation of the States, because the DPPA is generally applicable. The DPPA regulates the universe of entities that participate as suppliers to the market for motor vehicle information\\u0097the States as initial suppliers of the information in interstate commerce and private resellers or redisclosers of that information in commerce.\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore\\nReversed. \\n\",\n          \"Until now, the rule for pleading a claim under a federal\\nantidiscrimination statute was clear: A plaintiff had to\\nplausibly allege that discrimination was the but-for cause\\nof an adverse action, unless the statute\\u2019s text unequivocally\\nreplaced that standard with a different one. Today, how-\\never, the Court departs from this rule, concluding that the\\nfederal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Em-\\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) imposes liability if an\\nagency\\u2019s personnel actions are at all tainted by considera-\\ntions of age. See ante, at 1. This rule is so broad that a\\nplaintiff could bring a cause of action even if he is ultimately\\npromoted or hired over a younger applicant. This novel\\n\\u201cany consideration\\u201d standard does serious damage to our\\ninterpretation of antidiscrimination statutes and disrupts\\nthe settled expectations of federal employers and employ-\\nees.

Because the only thing being \\u201cmade\\u201d in the\\nstatute is a \\u201cpersonnel action,\\u201d it is entirely reasonable to\\nconclude that age must be the but-for cause of that person-\\nnel action.\\n   At most, the substantive mandate against discrimination\\nin \\u00a7633a(a) is ambiguous. And it goes without saying that\\nan ambiguous provision does not contain the clear language\\nnecessary to displace the default rule. Accordingly, I would\\nhold that the default rule of but-for causation applies here.\\n                              B\\n   The Court attempts to downplay the sweeping nature of\\nits novel \\u201cany consideration\\u201d rule by discussing the limited\\nremedies available under that rule. Specifically, the Court\\ndeclares that a plaintiff can obtain compensatory damages,\\nbackpay, and reinstatement only if he proves that age was\\na but-for cause of an adverse personnel action. Otherwise,\\nhe can obtain only injunctive or prospective relief. See ante,\\nat 13\\u201314.\\n   If the text of the ADEA contained this remedial scheme,\\n4                      BABB v.

Nor can it, as one does not exist. The Court also\\nfails to cite any authority suggesting that its remedial\\nscheme existed, at common law or otherwise, in 1974 when\\nCongress added the federal-sector provision to the ADEA.\\n\\u00a728(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74\\u201375.\\n   Instead, the Court principally relies on Texas v. Lesage,\\n528 U.S. 18 (1999) (per curiam), which applied Mt. Healthy\\nCity Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977). See Lesage,\\n528 U.S., at 20\\u201322. But Mt. Healthy and, by extension,\\nLesage do not assist the Court. In Mt. Healthy, the Court\\ncrafted, for the first time, a remedial scheme for constitu-\\ntional claims brought under 42 U.S. C. \\u00a71983. 429 U.S.,\\nat 285\\u2013287. Significantly, that decision postdates enact-\\nment of the federal-sector provision by three years. And Mt.\\nHealthy did not import a remedial scheme from a previously\\nexisting statute or common-law rule. Rather, the Court\\ncited other cases in which it had similarly fashioned a novel\\ncausation standard for constitutional claims\\u2014none of\\nwhich concerned remedies\\u2014as \\u201cinstructive in formulating\\nthe test to be applied.\\u201d Id., at 286\\u2013287. It is incongruous\\nto suggest that Congress could have intended to incorporate\\na remedial scheme that appears not to have existed at the\\ntime the statute was passed. Moreover, Mt. Healthy con-\\ncerned a constitutional injury, and the Court was tasked\\nwith creating a remedy for that injury in the face of \\u00a71983\\u2019s\\nsilence. The Court fails to provide any explanation as\\nto why it is appropriate to rely on judicially fashioned\\nremedies for constitutional injuries in this purely statutory\\ncontext.\\n   In sum, the Court implausibly concludes that, in the\\nfederal-sector provision of the ADEA, Congress created a novel\\n\\u201cany consideration\\u201d causation standard but remained com-\\npletely silent as to what remedies were available under that\\nnew rule. Just as implausibly, the Court assumes from this\\n                    Cite as: 589 U.

The federal-sector pro-\\nvision contains no clear language displacing the default\\nrule, and Congress has demonstrated that it knows how to\\ndo so when it wishes. See 42 U.S. C. \\u00a72000e\\u20132(m) (provid-\\ning that an employer is liable if an employee establishes\\nthat a protected characteristic was a motivating factor in\\nan employment action); \\u00a72000e\\u20135(g)(2)(B) (limiting the\\nremedies available to plaintiffs who establish motivating\\nfactor liability).1 Rather than supplementing a novel rule\\nwith a judicially crafted remedy, I would infer from the tex-\\ntual silence that Congress wrote the ADEA to conform to\\nthe default rule of but-for causation.\\n                              II\\n   Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Court\\u2019s analysis\\nis its failure to grapple with the sheer unworkability of its\\nrule. The Court contends that a plaintiff may successfully\\nbring a cause of action if age \\u201ctaint[s]\\u201d the making of a per-\\nsonnel action, even if the agency would have reached the\\nsame outcome absent any age-based discrimination.

See, e.g.,\\nNatofsky v. New York, 921 F.3d 337, 346\\u2013348 (CA2 2019); Gentry v. East\\nWest Partners Club Mgmt. Co., 816 F.3d 228, 233\\u2013236 (CA4 2016); Ser-\\nwatka v. Rockwell Automation, Inc., 591 F.3d 957, 961\\u2013964 (CA7 2010).\\n6                      BABB v. WILKIE\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\n16(a), the Court\\u2019s rule presumably applies to claims alleg-\\ning discrimination based on sex, race, religion, color, and\\nnational origin as well.\\n   The Court\\u2019s rule might have some purchase if, as Babb\\ncontends, the Federal Government purposely set up a\\npurely merit-based system for its personnel actions. But as\\nanyone with knowledge of the Federal Government\\u2019s hiring\\npractices knows, this is hardly the case. Federal hiring is\\nriddled with exceptions and affirmative action programs,\\nwhich by their very nature are not singularly focused on\\nmerit.\\n   A few examples suffice to demonstrate this point. The\\nVeterans Preference Act of 1944 entitles certain veterans,\\ntheir spouses, and their parents to preferences in hiring and\\nin retention during reductions in force.             5 U.S. C.\\n\\u00a7\\u00a72108(3), 3502, 3309; 5 CFR \\u00a7211.102 (2019). Affirmative\\naction exists for people with disabilities, both in competitive\\nand noncompetitive employment. See 29 U.S. C. \\u00a7791; 5\\nCFR \\u00a7213.3102(u); 29 CFR \\u00a71614.203(d) (2019). The Fed-\\neral Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program requires\\nagencies to implement recruitment plans for women and\\ncertain underrepresented minorities. 5 U.S. C. \\u00a77201; 5\\nCFR \\u00a7720.205. And Exec. Order No. 13171, 3 CFR 299\\n(2000), requires federal agencies to \\u201cprovide a plan for re-\\ncruiting Hispanics that creates a fully diverse work force\\nfor the agency in the 21st century.\\u201d Whatever the wisdom\\nof these policies, they are not strictly merit-based hiring.\\n   The Court\\u2019s new rule is irreconcilable with these various\\nprograms because affirmative action initiatives always\\ntaint personnel actions with consideration of a protected\\ncharacteristic. Consider Exec. Order No. 13583, 3 CFR 267\\n(2011), which directs agencies to \\u201cdevelop and implement a\\nmore comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on di-\\nversity and inclusion as a key component of their human\\nresources strategies.\\u201d To provide just one example of how\\nagencies are implementing this requirement, Customs and\\n                       Cite as: 589 U.

Programs such as these intentionally inject\\nrace, sex, and national origin into agencies\\u2019 hiring and pro-\\nmotion decisions at the express direction of the President or\\nCongress.\\n   A but-for (or even a motivating-factor2) standard of cau-\\nsation could coexist relatively easily with these affirmative\\naction programs, as it would be difficult for a plaintiff to\\nplausibly plead facts sufficient to establish the requisite\\ncausation. The Court\\u2019s rule, by contrast, raises the possi-\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n  2 Many Courts of Appeals apply the motivating-factor standard to\\n\\nfederal-sector Title VII claims. See, e.g., Ponce v. Billington, 679 F.3d 840,\\n844 (CADC 2012); Makky v. Chertoff, 541 F.3d 205, 213\\u2013214 (CA3 2008).\\nEven assuming this is a correct interpretation, see 42 U.S. C. \\u00a72000e\\u2013\\n16(d) (incorporating by reference the private-sector motivating-factor\\nprovisions), the Court\\u2019s \\u201cany consideration\\u201d rule imposes an even lower\\nbar. No party submitted briefing on the criteria that courts or the Equal\\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) use to establish a moti-\\nvating factor, but the cases from which this standard was derived indi-\\ncate that it mirrored the tort concept of substantial cause. See, e.g., Price\\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 249 (1989) (plurality opinion); Mt.\\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\\n8                         BABB v. WILKIE\\n\\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nbility that agencies will be faced with a flood of investiga-\\ntions by the EEOC or litigation from dissatisfied federal\\nemployees. So long as those employees can show that their\\nemployer\\u2019s decision to hire a particular job applicant was\\n\\u201ctainted\\u201d because that applicant benefited in some way\\nfrom an affirmative action program, their complaints to en-\\njoin these programs can survive at least the pleadings\\nstage.3\\n                        *     *    *\\n  Today\\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the default rule un-\\nderlying our interpretation of antidiscrimination statutes\\nand our precedents, which have consistently applied that\\nrule. Perhaps just as important, the Court\\u2019s holding unnec-\\nessarily risks imposing hardship on those tasked with man-\\naging thousands of employees within our numerous federal\\nagencies. I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n  3 On this score, it is worth mentioning that even the EEOC has not\\n\\nadopted the Court\\u2019s low bar but instead employs a motivating-factor\\nstandard.

For another thing,\\nGraham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin-\\nishes the \\u201cmoral culpability\\u201d that attaches to the crime in\\nquestion, making those that do not intend to kill \\u201ccategori-\\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish-\\nment than are murderers.\\u201d 560 U.

Quite simply, if the juvenile\\neither kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \\u201ctwice\\ndiminished\\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither\\nkills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra-\\nham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would\\npermit life without parole for \\u201cjuveniles who commit the\\nworst types of murder,\\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,\\nC. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of\\none who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\\n  I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,\\nthe question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-\\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\nmurder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in\\nthe course of a felony to all participants who intended to\\ncommit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or\\nintended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\\nLaw \\u00a7\\u00a714.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been\\nbased on the idea of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d; the defendant\\u2019s\\nintent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill\\nrequired for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.\\nStreiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.\\n2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\\u2019s Criminal Law \\u00a7147 (15th ed.\\n1994).\\n   But in my opinion, this type of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d is\\nnot sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could\\nsubject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As\\nan initial matter, this Court has made clear that this\\nartificially constructed kind of intent does not count as\\nintent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not\\nrely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may\\nreceive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids\\nimposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in\\na robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and\\nsimply was \\u201cin the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting\\nto help the robbers escape.\\u201d Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.\\nTison, supra, at 157\\u2013158 (capital punishment permissi-\\nble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death\\nbecause he was \\u201cactively involved\\u201d in every aspect of the\\nkidnaping and his behavior showed \\u201ca reckless disregard\\nfor human life\\u201d). Given Graham, this holding applies to\\njuvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See\\nante, at 12\\u201313. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison\\nstandard of \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d may not be eligible for life\\nwithout parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The\\nonly juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to\\nlife without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses\\nwho \\u201ckill or intend to kill.\\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\\nat 18).\\n4                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\n   Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,\\nthere is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without\\nparole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to\\nkill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\\u2019s\\nintent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan-\\ngerous felony should understand the risk that the victim\\nof the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2\\nLaFave, supra, \\u00a714.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the\\nfull consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\\u2019s\\nconduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles\\nlack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8\\u20139. Justice Frank-\\nfurter cautioned, \\u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in\\nother cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit-\\nically transferred to a determination of a State\\u2019s duty to-\\nward children.\\u201d May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528, 536\\n(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of\\ntransferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to\\nsentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve\\nsuch \\u201cfallacious reasoning.\\u201d Ibid.\\n   This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres-\\nent in Kuntrell Jackson\\u2019s case. Jackson simply went\\nalong with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he\\nbecame aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially\\nstayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some-\\nthing like \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t playin\\u2019 \\u201d or \\u201c \\u2018I thought you all was\\nplayin,\\u2019 \\u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the\\nstore clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S.W.3d\\n757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of\\nfirst-degree murder under a statute that permitted them\\nto convict if, Jackson \\u201cattempted to commit or committed\\nan aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of-\\nfense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\\u2019s] death\\nunder circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the\\nvalue of human life.\\u201d Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. \\u00a75\\u201310\\u2013\\n101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,\\nJackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did\\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\\n\\nnot), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \\u201cex-\\ntreme indifference.\\u201d As long as one of the teenage accom-\\nplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to\\nthe value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of\\ncapital murder. Ibid.\\n   The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,\\nmight not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.\\nNorris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,\\nJ., dissenting) (\\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\\u2019s] intent to kill\\nwas severely lacking\\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amend-\\nment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the\\npossibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a\\nfinding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\\u2019s death,\\nthe question remains open whether the Eighth Amend-\\nment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a\\njuvenile in those circumstances as well.

SANCHEZ VALLE, ET AL.\",\n          \"The Court today disregards the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Civil Rules) in habeas corpus cases, chiefly because it believes that this departure will make no difference. See ante, at 209. Even if that were true, which it is not, I could not join this novel presumption against applying the Civil Rules.\\nThe Civil Rules \\\"govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature.\\\" Rule 1. This includes \\\"proceedings for . . . habeas corpus,\\\" Rule 81(a)(2), but only \\\"to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States [or] the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases\\\" (Habeas Rules), Civil Rule 81(a)(2); see also Habeas Rule 11. Thus, \\\"[t]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,\\\" Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 208 (2003), and do not contradict or undermine the provisions of the habeas corpus statute, Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 529-530 (2005).\\nAs the Court notes, the Civil Rules adopt the traditional forfeiture rule for unpleaded limitations defenses. See ante, at 207-208 (citing Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). The Court does not identify any \\\"inconsisten[cy]\\\" between this forfeiture rule and the statute, Rules, or historical practice of habeas proceedings\\u0097because there is none. Forfeiture of the limitations defense is demonstrably not inconsistent with traditional habeas practice, because, as the Court acknowledges, habeas practice included no statute of limitations until 1996. Ante, at 202, n. 1; see also infra, at 214-216. Forfeiture is perfectly consistent with Habeas Rule 5(b), which now provides that the State's \\\"answer . . . must state whether any *213 claim in the petition is barred by . . . statute of limitations.\\\" (Emphasis added.) And forfeiture is also consistent with (and indeed, arguably suggested by) Habeas Rule 4, because Rule 4 provides for sua sponte screening and dismissal of habeas petitions only prior to the filing of the State's responsive pleading.[1]\\nMost importantly, applying the forfeiture rule to the limitations period of 28 U.S. C. \\u00a7 2244(d) does not contradict or undermine any provision of the habeas statute. Quite the contrary, on its most natural reading, the statute calls for the forfeiture rule. AEDPA expressly enacted, without further qualification, \\\"[a] 1-year period of limitation\\\" for habeas applications by persons in custody pursuant to the judgments of state courts. \\u00a7 2244(d)(1) (emphasis added). We have repeatedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods such as that in \\u00a7 2244(d), without further elaboration, produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus subject to waiver and forfeiture. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982); see also Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 15 (2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 447 (2004). Absent some affirmative incompatibility with habeas practice, there is no reason why a habeas limitations period should be any different. By imposing an unqualified \\\"period of limitation\\\" against the background understanding that a defense of \\\"limitations\\\" must be raised in the answer, see Civil Rules 8(c), 12(b), the statute implies that the usual forfeiture rule is applicable.\\n*214 Instead of identifying an inconsistency between habeas corpus practice and the usual civil forfeiture rule, the Court urges that \\\"it would make scant sense to distinguish in this regard AEDPA's time bar from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners\\\" that may be raised sua sponte\\u0097ante, at 209\\u0097namely, exhaustion of state remedies, procedural default, nonretroactivity, and (prior to AEDPA) abuse of the writ. See Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 133 (1987) (exhaustion); Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 389 (1994) (nonretroactivity). But unlike AEDPA's statute of limitations, these defenses were all created by the habeas courts themselves, in the exercise of their traditional equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 717-718 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), because they were seen as necessary to protect the interests of comity and finality that federal collateral review of state criminal proceedings necessarily implicates. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 489-491 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 80-81 (1977) (procedural default); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 308 (1989) (nonretroactivity); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515 (1982) (exhaustion of state remedies). Unlike these other defenses, no time limitation\\u0097not even equitable laches\\u0097was imposed to vindicate comity and finality. AEDPA's 1-year limitations period is entirely a recent creature of statute. See ante, at 202, n. 1. If comity and finality did not compel any time limitation at all, it follows a fortiori that they do not compel making a legislatively created, forfeitable time limitation nonforfeitable.\\nIn fact, prior to the enactment of AEDPA, we affirmatively rejected the notion that habeas courts' traditionally broad discretionary powers would support their imposition of a time bar. Historically, \\\"there [wa]s no statute of limitations governing federal habeas, and the only laches recognized [wa]s that which affects the State's ability to defend against the claims raised on habeas\\\"\\u0097which was imposed by *215 Rule, and not until 1977. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993); see also United States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475 (1947); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 4268.2, pp. 497-498 (2d ed. 1988) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). We repeatedly asserted that the passage of time alone could not extinguish the habeas corpus rights of a person subject to unconstitutional incarceration. See Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 123 (1956); Chessman v. Teets, 354 U.S. 156, 164-165 (1957). For better or for worse, this doctrine was so well entrenched that the lower courts regularly entertained petitions filed after even extraordinary delays. See, e. g., Hawkins v. Bennett, 423 F.2d 948, 949 (CA8 1970) (40 years); Hamilton v. Watkins, 436 F.2d 1323, 1325 (CA5 1970) (at least 36 years); Hannon v. Maschner, 845 F.2d 1553, 1553-1555 (CA10 1988) (at least 24 years). And in 1977, when enactment of the former Habeas Rule 9(a) \\\"introduce[d] for the first time an element of laches into habeas corpus,\\\" 17A Wright & Miller \\u00a7 4268.2, at 498\\u0097by adopting the rule against \\\"`prejudicial delay'\\\" to which the Court refers, ante, at 202, n. 1\\u0097even that limited doctrine was treated as subject to the very same pleading requirements and forfeiture rule that the Court rejects today for the stricter limitations period of \\u00a7 2244(d). See Smith v. Secretary of New Mexico Dept. of Corrections, 50 F.3d 801, 821-822, n. 30 (CA10 1995); see also McDonnell v. Estelle, 666 F.2d 246, 249 (CA5 1982).\\nThere is, therefore, no support for the notion that the traditional equitable discretion that governed habeas proceedings permitted the dismissal of habeas petitions on the sole ground of untimeliness. Whether or not it should have, see Collins v. Byrd, 510 U.S. 1185, 1186-1187 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting), it did not. The Court's reliance on pre-existing equitable doctrines like procedural default and nonretroactivity is, therefore, utterly misplaced. Nothing in our tradition of refusing to dismiss habeas petitions as untimely *216 justifies the Court's decision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \\\"limitations period\\\" of \\u00a7 2244(d) by making it the subject of sua sponte dismissal.\\nIn what appears to be the chief ground of its decision, the Court also observes that \\\"the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting sua sponte, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the State's answer\\\" under Civil Rule 15(a). Ante, at 209. Although \\\"an amendment to the State's answer might have obviated this controversy,\\\" the Court concedes, \\\"we see no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.\\\" Ibid. But this consideration cuts in the opposite direction. If there truly were no \\\"dispositive difference\\\" between following and disregarding the rules that Congress has enacted, the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to disregard the Civil Rules.[2] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written. And, unlike the novel regime that the Court adopts today, which will apparently require the development of new rules from scratch, there already exists a well-developed body of law to govern the district courts' exercise of discretion under Rule *217 15(a). See 6 Wright & Miller \\u00a7\\u00a7 1484-1488 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2005). Ockham is offended by today's decision, even if no one else is.\\nBut, in fact, there are at least two notable differences between the Civil Rules and the sua sponte regime of such cases as Granberry and Caspari\\u0097both of which involve sufficiently significant departures from ordinary civil practice as to require clear authorization from the statute, the Rules, or historical habeas practice. First, the Granberry regime allows the forfeited procedural defense to be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the State or by the appellate court sua sponte. See 481 U.S., at 130, 133; Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 228-229 (1994). Ordinary civil practice does not allow a forfeited affirmative defense whose underlying facts were not developed below to be raised for the first time on appeal. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 764 (1975); Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1287 (CA7 1977). The ability to raise even constitutional errors in criminal trials for the first time on appeal is narrowly circumscribed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993). Comity and finality justified this departure from ordinary practice for historically rooted equitable defenses such as exhaustion. See Granberry, supra, at 134. But limitations was not such a defense.\\nAlso, Granberry and the like raise the possibility that the courts can impose a procedural defense over the State's affirmative decision to waive that defense. The Court takes care to point out that this is not such a case, ante, at 210-211, but it invites such cases in the future. After all, the principal justification for allowing such defenses to be raised sua sponte is that they \\\"`implicat[e] values beyond the concerns of the parties,'\\\" including \\\"`judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources'\\\" and \\\"the expeditious handling of habeas proceedings.\\\" Ante, at 205, 208 (quoting Acosta v. Artuz, 221 F.3d 117, 123 (CA2 2000)). There are *218 many reasons why the State may wish to disregard the statute of limitations, including the simple belief that it would be unfair to impose the limitations defense on a particular defendant. On the Court's reasoning, a district court would not abuse its discretion in overriding the State's conscious waiver of the defense in order to protect such \\\"`values beyond the concerns of the parties,'\\\" ante, at 205.[3] Under the Civil Rules, by contrast, amending a party's pleading over his objection would constitute a clear abuse of the trial court's discretion.\\nIn sum, applying the ordinary rule of forfeiture to the AEDPA statute of limitations creates no inconsistency with the Habeas Rules. On the contrary, it is the Court's unwarranted *219 expansion of the timeliness rule enacted by Congress that is inconsistent with the statute, the Habeas Rules, the Civil Rules, and traditional practice. I would hold that the ordinary forfeiture rule, as codified in the Civil Rules, applies to the limitations period of \\u00a7 2244(d). I respectfully dissent.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 2006,\n        \"max\": 2016,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2012,\n          2016,\n          2006\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Breyer\",\n          \"Ginsburg\",\n          \"Scalia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"dissenting\",\n          \"concurring\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I join the Court\\u2019s opinion in full.

Given \\u2019s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills nor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \\u201ctwice diminished\\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra- ham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would permit life without parole for \\u201cjuveniles who commit the worst types of murder,\\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of one who did not himself kill or intend to kill. I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases, the question of intent is a complicated one. The felony- Cite as: 567 U. S. (2012) 3 BREYER, J., concurring murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in the course of a felony to all participants who intended to commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or intended to kill. See 2 W. Substantive Criminal Law and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been based on the idea of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d; the defendant\\u2019s intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill required for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C. Streiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed. 2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\\u2019s Criminal Law (15th ed. 1994). But in my opinion, this type of \\u201ctransferred intent\\u201d is not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as intent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may receive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and simply was \\u201cin the car by the side of the road waiting to help the robbers escape.\\u201d Cf. at 157\\u2013158 (capital punishment permissi- ble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death because he was \\u201cactively involved\\u201d in every aspect of the kidnaping and his behavior showed \\u201ca reckless disregard for human life\\u201d). Given this holding applies to juvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See ante, at 12\\u201313. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the standard of \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d may not be eligible for life without parole. Rather, dictates a clear rule: The only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses who \\u201ckill or intend to kill.\\u201d 560 U. S., at (slip op., at 18). 4 MILLER v. ALABAMA BREYER, J., concurring Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults, there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to kill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\\u2019s intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan- gerous felony should understand the risk that the victim of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2 Yet the ability to consider the full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\\u2019s conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles lack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8\\u20139. Justice Frank- furter cautioned, \\u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit- ically transferred to a determination of a State\\u2019s duty to- ward children.\\u201d (1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve such \\u201cfallacious reasoning.\\u201d This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres- ent in Kuntrell Jackson\\u2019s case. Jackson simply went along with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he became aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some- thing like \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t playin\\u2019 \\u201d or \\u201c \\u2018I thought you all was playin,\\u2019 \\u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the store clerk. 194 S.W.3d 757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them to convict if, Jackson \\u201cattempted to commit or committed an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of- fense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\\u2019s] death under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\\u201d See \\u201310\\u2013 101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty, Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did Cite as: 567 U. S. (2012) 5 BREYER, J., concurring not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \\u201cex- treme indifference.\\u201d As long as one of the teenage accom- plices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of capital murder. The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk, might not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v. Norris, S. W. 3d (Danielson, J., dissenting) (\\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\\u2019s] intent to kill was severely lacking\\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amend- ment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the possibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\\u2019s death, the question remains open whether the Eighth Amend- ment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a juvenile in those circumstances as well.

The matter warrants attention in a future case in which a defendant faces successive prosecutions by parts of the whole USA. Cite as: 579 U. S. (2016) 1 Opinion of THOMAS, J. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 15\\u2013108 COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, PETITIONER v. LUIS M. SANCHEZ VALLE, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PUERTO RICO [June 9, 2016] JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. The Court today concludes that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States are not separate sover- eigns because the Federal Government is the ultimate source of Puerto Rico\\u2019s authority to prosecute crimes. Ante, at 16. I agree with that holding, which hews to the Court\\u2019s precedents concerning the Double Jeopardy Clause and U. S. Territories. But I continue to have concerns about our precedents regarding Indian law, see United (opinion concurring in judgment), and I cannot join the portions of the opinion concerning the application of the Double Jeop- ardy Clause to successive prosecutions involving Indian tribes. Aside from this caveat, I join the Court\\u2019s opinion. Cite as: 579 U. S.
